It’s a classic, and the main point is that good design should make everything painfully obvious to users without demanding anything of them. Resumes are just the same. Your resume shouldn’t make recruiters think. It should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less. Before I share some resume tips, there’s something important I want to reiterate: Don’t spend a lot of time on your resume. You can read my piece about how resume writing is snake oil, but the TL;DR is that recruiters spend a median of 30 seconds looking at resumes, and most of that is spent looking for top-tier companies. If you don’t have top-tier companies (and in some cases niche skills), wordsmithing your bullets or rearranging your sections or changing your layout won’t help. If you do have top-tier companies, sometimes doing some wordsmithing and rearrangement will help… if your top company experience or niche skills are buried. If you don’t have top-tier brands, the best bang for your buck is to switch from online applications to hiring manager outreach. Here’s how to do it. With that said, I know that no matter what I say, people will still grind on their resumes instead of doing outreach. Grinding on resumes is safe. Outreach is scary and opens you up to personal (rather than impersonal) rejection. So, look, if you’re going to do something to your resume, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Unlike the endless resume tweaking that most candidates do, these changes directly address how recruiters actually read resumes. Here we go. Stop putting filler buzzwords in your \"About\" section. Use it to spell out the most impressive things about you. Your \"About\" or \"Summary\" section is prime real estate. Yet so many candidates fill this section with meaningless jargon like \"passionate self-starter\" or \"detail-oriented team player.\" Instead, use this section to explicitly tell recruiters the 2-3 most impressive things about you in plain English. This is your chance to control the narrative. Want recruiters to take something away from reading your resume? Don’t assume they’ll figure it out. They’re not reading it long enough to intuit anything. Spell it out for them verbatim in this section. Do this, not that: ❌ Results-driven full-stack engineer with a passion for scalable systems and user-centric design ✅ Senior engineer with 3 years at Amazon, promoted twice in 3 years (2X the company average)1 Don’t include your GPA if it’s under 3.8 This is simple but effective: only include your GPA if it's 3.8 or higher2. A middling GPA doesn't help your case and might inadvertently signal academic mediocrity. If your GPA isn't stellar, focus on other academic achievements: hackathons, technical competitions, fellowships or scholarships. These provide better signals about your capabilities than a so-so GPA. Context matters for lesser-known companies If you've worked at Google or Facebook, recruiters instantly get what kind of company you're coming from. But when you have \"TechStartup123\" on your resume, they have no idea what they're looking at or how impressive it might be. For lesser-known companies, include a one-line description explaining what the company does, along with any impressive metrics or investors: ❌ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc.\" ✅ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc. ($50M Series B from Sequoia, 2M+ active users)\" This simple addition provides crucial context that helps recruiters evaluate your experience properly. Without it, they might discount valuable experience simply because they don't recognize the company name. Avoid the \"job-hopper\" misperception Here's a common mistake: listing each role at the same company as if they were separate jobs. This can make recruiters think you've job-hopped, which is often seen as a red flag. Instead, group different roles under the same company heading: ❌ Listing separate entries for \"Junior Developer at XYZ\" and \"Senior Developer at XYZ\" ✅ \"XYZ Company - Senior Developer (2021-Present) - Junior Developer (2019-2021) Promoted in 2 years vs. company average of 3.5 years\" The second format clearly shows growth within a single company and explicitly highlights faster-than-average promotion, which is a strong positive signal. (You may also want to carry over your promotion cadence into your “About” section, as you saw above.) Be crystal clear about your work authorization status This one is particularly crucial if you have a foreign-sounding name and/or education outside the US. I've seen many qualified candidates get passed over because recruiters assumed they needed visa sponsorship when they actually didn't. Don't leave this to chance. Make your work status explicit in your header or summary section: ❌ No mention of work authorization (leaving recruiters to guess) ✅ \"US Citizen\" or \"Green Card Holder\" or \"Authorized to work in the US without visa sponsorship\" Career changers: provide context about the change If you've switched careers, your resume can look confusing without proper context. Recruiters might struggle to understand why someone with your background is applying for this role, or they might not recognize how your previous experience translates to your current trajectory. Address this head-on in your “About” section. ❌ Listing previous career experience with no explanation of your transition ✅ \"Transitioned from marketing to software engineering in 2021 after completing a bootcamp\" or \"Former accountant who pivoted to data science through self-study and online courses while continuing full-time work\" This context helps recruiters understand your timeline and puts your current title and achievements in perspective. Without it, you risk serious misinterpretation: Recruiters might think you're far more junior than you actually are in your new field (potentially ruling you out for appropriate-level positions) Or conversely, they might assume you have years of relevant experience in your new field (and then wonder why you haven't achieved more in that time) Both misinterpretations can be fatal to your application. By providing a clear timeline of your transition, you help recruiters accurately gauge your experience level and set appropriate expectations. This transparency also demonstrates valuable traits like adaptability and determination. And here's another key point for career changers: you don't need to list all your previous positions before the transition... unless they're impressive. Be selective about what pre-transition experience you include: ❌ DON'T include mundane or irrelevant details from your previous career that add nothing to your current narrative. Your three years as a retail associate before becoming a developer probably won't strengthen your software engineering application. ✅ DO highlight prestigious achievements from your previous career. If you were, say, a concert pianist, a lawyer who graduated from a top-tier law school, or a management consultant at McKinsey, absolutely include that. These signal that you're smart and high-achieving, regardless of domain. In conclusion If you do all these things, you may or may not see a return. After all, even the impact of these tweaks pales in comparison to having top brands on your resume. But, given that these will take you a few minutes to do, it doesn’t hurt.

Yes, every once in a while, a side project goes viral. Or if you build something really cool with your target company’s API, it can get some attention. But that’s pretty rare. Most side projects that adorn resumes go completely unnoticed. When it comes to performing well in interviews, it depends. If the companies you’re interviewing at test you on practical skills, then they can be a great use of time. They can also be a great use of time to help you understand how APIs work, how the internet works, how clients and servers talk to each other, and so on. But if the companies you’re targeting primarily ask algorithmic questions, then side projects probably aren’t the best use of time. Finally, will side projects make you a better engineer? Absolutely. And that’s the best reason to do them. But that’s not quite the same as getting a job, is it? Once you're actively looking for a job, your time is better spent on interview prep and outreach. ↩",

Despite how devastating these freezes were to affected candidates (and to the tech economy as whole), they are extremely rare, and in our humble opinion, not worth optimizing for or worrying about. You are very unlikely to have to deal with an impending freeze. ↩ Some companies will also have technical deep dives, project presentations, assessments of niche skills, and so on. ↩",

It's fittingly called Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview.. Now, we're releasing 9 chapters of the book for free! There are two PDFs in the linked folder: The first seven chapters of the book, covering topics such as why technical interviews are broken, what recruiters won't tell you, why not to spend a lot of time on resumes, and how to get in the door at companies without a referral. Two technical chapters: Sliding Windows and Binary Search. Our new take on Binary Search teaches one template that works for every binary search problem on LeetCode, with only a single-line change you need to remember. The Sliding Windows chapter features 6 unique sliding window templates that make off-by-one errors a thing of the past. Take a look, and let me know what you think.

Read 9 chapters for free →interviewing.ioOpen menuInterview resourcesFor employersGift mock interviewsBlogFAQLog inGive it a tryBlog HomeWe co-wrote the official sequel to Cracking the Coding Interview!By Aline Lerner | Published: January 27, 2025; Last updated: April 28, 2025EDIT 2: Read 9 chapters of the book for free! These include: The first seven chapters of the book, covering topics such as why technical interviews are broken, what recruiters won't tell you, why not to spend a lot of time on resumes, and how to get in the door at companies without a referral. Two technical chapters: Sliding Windows and Binary Search. Our new take on Binary Search teaches one template that works for every binary search problem on LeetCode, with only a single-line change you need to remember. The Sliding Windows chapter features 6 unique sliding window templates that make off-by-one errors a thing of the past. EDIT: Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview is out now! Here's the table of contents: I have some exciting news. Along with Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Mike Mroczka, and Nil Mamano, I’m writing the official sequel to Cracking the Coding Interview (often called the bible of technical interview prep). It's fittingly called Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. I’ve always wanted to write a book about technical interviewing. And this is it. And of course it'll draw on all the hiring data we've collected over the past decade at interviewing.io. Technical interviews are much harder today than they used to be. Engineers study for months and routinely get down-leveled despite that. Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview, in addition to covering a bunch of new questions and topics, teaches you how to think instead of memorizing. Grinding and memorization isn’t the way in this market (though in fairness, it’s never really the way). With us, you’ll still have to do the work, of course, but we’ll teach you to work smarter. We added at least thirteen new technical topics (I say “at least” because we’re still writing, and it might be more like twenty)—and over 150 new problems. Each problem includes step-by-step walkthroughs, and you can work each problem with our (actually good) AI Interviewer. And of course this book was written in partnership with interviewing.io. We’ve pulled in data from over 100k FAANG mock interviews on interviewing.io, and we include hundreds of curated interview replays from interviewing.io (shared with permission of course) – watch people make mistakes and learn so you’re not doomed to repeat them. But it’s not just about interview prep. In today’s job market, the bar is higher but it’s also harder than ever to get noticed and run your job search end-to-end. My excellent co-authors killed it on the technical chapters. I focused on writing the job search stuff, including, but not limited to: How to negotiate, exactly what to say, and how to not screw up your negotiations before they even start How to manage your job search, end to end, and balance interview prep with applications and outreach A worksheet to help you figure out what order you need to engage with the companies you’re targeting to ensure that all your offers come in at the same time How to get in the door at top companies without relying on referrals, including email templates and examples of good and bad outreach An internal look at FAANG (and other) company rubrics to help understand what interviewers really care about, no matter what company you're applying to What you need to know about behavioral interviews, whether you want to or not, and how to avoid the mistakes that even great engineers make A list of very specific questions to ask your interviewers (not just to look smart but to learn useful things) How technical interviews got to be so broken and how to get over hating them so you can win I also spend some time on owning and sharing data on how flawed technical interviewing is and, most importantly, how to manage your psychology so you can get past that. I see so many engineers opting out of this interview style, arguably for good reason. But you’re leaving a lot of good opportunities on the table, and it doesn’t have to be like that. This book is so much of what I’ve blogged about for the last 15 years, but it’s fleshed out with much more detail and actionable advice. If you read it, let me know what you think. Technical interviewing sucks (and so does looking for a job). But this book will help you do it well and get out alive. Purchases of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview get a $50 discount for interviewing.io. The book costs $45, so it’s not a bad deal.

Here's the table of contents:\\\\n\\\\n!\\[Beyond CtCI table of contents\\](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cover\\_toc\\_b77bec4593.png)\\\\n\\\\nI have some exciting news. Along with Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Mike Mroczka, and Nil Mamano, I’m writing the official sequel to \\_Cracking the Coding Interview\\_ (often called the bible of technical interview prep). It's fittingly called \\[\\_Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview.\\_\\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X)\\\\n\\\\nI’ve always wanted to write a book about technical interviewing. And this is it. And of course it'll draw on all the hiring data we've collected over the past decade at interviewing.io.\\\\n\\\\nTechnical interviews are much harder today than they used to be. Engineers study for months and routinely get down-leveled despite that. \\[\\_Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview\\_\\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X), in addition to covering a bunch of new questions and topics, teaches you how to think instead of memorizing. Grinding and memorization isn’t the way in this market (though in fairness, it’s never really the way). With us, you’ll still have to do the work, of course, but we’ll teach you to work smarter.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X\\\\\"\\\\u003e\\\\u003cimg src=\\\\\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/book\\_cover\\_87f67665fd.png\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview book cover\\\\\" style=\\\\\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:300px;\\\\\"/\\\\u003e\\\\u003c/a\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\nWe added at least thirteen new technical topics (I say “at least” because we’re still writing, and it might be more like twenty)—and over 150 new problems. Each problem includes step-by-step walkthroughs, and you can work each problem with our (actually good) AI Interviewer. And of course this book was written in partnership with interviewing.io. We’ve pulled in data from over 100k FAANG mock interviews on interviewing.io, and we include hundreds of curated interview replays from interviewing.io (shared with permission of course) – watch people make mistakes and learn so you’re not doomed to repeat them.\\\\n\\\\nBut it’s not \\_just\\_ about interview prep. In today’s job market, the bar is higher but it’s also harder than ever to get noticed and run your job search end-to-end. My excellent co-authors killed it on the technical chapters. I focused on writing the job search stuff, including, but not limited to:\\\\n\\\\n\\* How to negotiate, exactly what to say, and how to not screw up your negotiations before they even start\\\\n\\* How to manage your job search, end to end, and balance interview prep with applications and outreach\\\\n\\* A worksheet to help you figure out what order you need to engage with the companies you’re targeting to ensure that all your offers come in at the same time\\\\n\\* How to get in the door at top companies without relying on referrals, including email templates and examples of good and bad outreach\\\\n\\* An internal look at FAANG (and other) company rubrics to help understand what interviewers really care about, no matter what company you're applying to\\\\n\\* What you need to know about behavioral interviews, whether you want to or not, and how to avoid the mistakes that even great engineers make\\\\n\\* A list of very specific questions to ask your interviewers (not just to look smart but to learn useful things)\\\\n\\* How technical interviews got to be so broken and how to get over hating them so you can win\\\\n\\\\nI also spend some time on owning and sharing data on how flawed technical interviewing is and, most importantly, how to manage your psychology so you can get past that. I see so many engineers opting out of this interview style, arguably for good reason. But you’re leaving a lot of good opportunities on the table, and it doesn’t have to be like that.\\\\n\\\\nThis book is so much of what I’ve blogged about for the last 15 years, but it’s fleshed out with much more detail and actionable advice. If you read it, let me know what you think. Technical interviewing sucks (and so does looking for a job). But this book will help you do it well and get out alive.\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Purchases of \\[\\_Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview\\_\\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X) get a $50 discount for interviewing.io. The book costs $45, so it’s not a bad deal. The book is out in January of 2025, and you can \\[get it on Amazon\\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X).\\*\\*\\\\n\",\"excerpt\":\"Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Mike Mroczka, and Nil Mamano, and I have written the official sequel to \\_Cracking the Coding Interview\\_ (often called the bible of technical interview prep).

I believe that as well. ↩ There are many sources arguing for and against diversity leading to better-performing teams. Here are some examples: For: https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters Against: https://medium.com/the-liberators/in-depth-the-double-edged-sword-of-diversity-in-teams-765ff72a55da (except for “age diversity”) and https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/05/25/diversity-and-performance-in-entrepreneurial-teams/ ↩ One of the most insulting examples of the “we need a diverse workforce to serve our diverse customer base” argument occurred when I was pitching Amazon on using interviewing.io to hire. This was years ago, and back then, out of curiosity, I’d always ask the organizations we were pitching why they valued diversity. I don’t think I ever got a good answer, but this one was especially bad. One of the recruiters we met with went on a long diatribe about how Amazon sells lots of shoes and you need women on the eng team because women understand shoes better than men. ↩ Getting more women and people of color to study computer science is a worthy cause. Hell, getting anyone who’s historically been marginalized to study computer science is worthwhile. It’s great for our economy, and it’s currently one of the best levers for upward social mobility available. But, while we hope more companies do these things, it is not reasonable to expect that companies can be responsible for educational interventions that often need to start at the elementary school level. Of course, companies should do what they can. But expecting them to pull off mathematical impossibilities is irrational, and the DEI movement’s stalwart refusal to acknowledge the pipeline problem undermines the movement as a whole. ↩ I was actually able to get in touch with a former OFCCP higher-up who admitted that rejecting anonymity in hiring was against the spirit of OFCCP requirements. But they sadly wouldn’t go on the record. ↩ The closest we’ve ever come to doing this is our Fellowship program, where we gave free practice to engineers from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. It was a great program, but what made it great was that our interviewers were eager to help these candidates. We were able to do free practice because our interviewers graciously agreed not to charge. That said, if I were to run this program again, I’d probably focus more on socioeconomic status and non-traditional credentials rather than just race and gender. ↩ Here’s the email we ended the relationship with. I’m including it because it was hard to write and even harder to hit send on, but I think we did the right thing, and maybe someone else will need to write something like this in the future… in which case, please steal our copy. ↩ Research that shows that having attended a top school isn’t very predictive and that, while experience at a top company is somewhat predictive, it’s not the most important thing: Lessons from 3,000 technical interviews… or how what you do after graduation matters way more than where you went to school We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered. It didn't. Lessons from a year’s worth of hiring data ↩ ↩2 Anyone who’s read my writing for a long time will pause here and wonder why I’m OK with resumes and recommending anything about reading them. Until recently, I was stalwartly against resumes and convinced that they carried no signal whatsoever. Then, as part of the recruiter study I mentioned, we built some simple ML models to judge resumes and compared their performance to human recruiters. They all outperformed recruiters, and that surprising result made me reverse my stance. ↩ First study (2014): https://interviewing.io/blog/resumes-suck-heres-the-data Second study (2024): https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes ↩ There are other gaps that start way before someone gets to college.

For example, say MIT has a course that emphasizes coding puzzles, and MIT grads also get better jobs. In that case, what might look like a LeetCode benefit is actually an MIT benefit, and controlling for that would make the apparent benefit disappear. At the very least, though, these patterns are informative about the typical profile of successful engineers, which is likely a useful thing to emulate in general. Also, remember that our data still shows solving a healthy number of questions regardless of their difficulty can boost your chances of getting through difficult interviews.

          "content": "Footnotes First, here’s how we got to these rankings. We asked each engineer who took our survey to rank all the channels they used to get in the door, from best to worst. Then we tallied up the points (+1 for best two channels, -1 for worst two). We didn’t do a more granular point system (e.g., +2 and -2) because the difference between the top two channels wasn’t always 2X, and generally, from talking to our users, preferences were somewhat muddy. As such, these results are directionally correct, but we didn’t feel comfortable numerically comparing them to one another. Finally, we divided the total tally by the number of times that channel came up. As a result, we were able to rank channels from most effective to least effective. ↩ This is why I generally view resume writers as selling snake oil. Either you have the things recruiters are looking for or you don’t. If you don’t, no amount of wordsmithing your bullet points or reorganizing the page is going to make a significant difference. Sure, check your resume for typos, and make sure that it reads decently well. Any more time invested in your resume after those basic things will have diminishing returns. Beware of anyone who tells you otherwise, and beware of any products or services who charge for resume review. ↩ We realize that recruiters won’t always have access to your resume when doing outreach and are likely looking at your LinkedIn instead. The same advice stands. Make sure that your About section has all the most important tidbits about you, front and center. Also, even though we didn’t see the same strong preference for FAANGs and URM status when applying online (more on that in the next section), making these types of changes to your resume certainly won’t hurt. ↩ Of course we don’t share the point of view that you can only be a good candidate if you have a brand-name company on your resume. However, many recruiters do, and they are still ignoring this channel. ↩ We’d argue that the value to companies is limited as well. Though there are a handful of excellent agency recruiters out there, most are terrible. The hard thing is that, as an employer, you can’t immediately tell who’s terrible, and you end up wasting a bunch of time reviewing profiles of candidates who might look promising on the surface, but because of selection bias (these are the people who decided to work with bad agency recruiters, after all) are not a fit. That or they’re not interested in your company (and have possibly never even opted in to talk to you) or both. ↩ At larger companies, recruiting is usually split into two functions: sourcing (these are the people who reach out to candidates) and recruiting (these are the people who manage candidates’ journey through the process and extend offers). In this post, for simplicity, we’re lumping them together because separating them out would change some of the details but wouldn’t change the key takeaways. ↩ Note that if you’re interested in smaller startups (Series A and below), you can substitute “founder” for “hiring manager” in the steps below. Founders are the most incentivized to get shit done and take risks, regardless of company size and stage, but at larger startups, they may be less likely to read cold emails because they get bombarded with all manners of requests and sales pitches. At a Series B or C company or at public companies with fewer than, say, 3000 employees, in addition to hiring managers, you should also target Directors and VPs — they have the power to get things done and aren’t so far removed from feeling the pain of not filling roles that making an extra hire or two is out of their purview. At large public companies, targeting Directors and above doesn’t make much sense — they ARE too far removed from doing the work to make individual hires. If you do contact them, the best outcome is that they’ll pass you on to one of their direct reports. ↩",

          "title": "Why engineers don’t like take-homes – and how companies can fix them",
          "content": "We helped write the sequel to \"Cracking the Coding Interview\". Read 9 chapters for free →interviewing.ioOpen menuInterview resourcesFor employersGift mock interviewsBlogFAQLog inGive it a tryBlog HomeWhy engineers don’t like take-homes – and how companies can fix themBy Aline Lerner | Published: July 17, 2024; Last updated: July 23, 2024\\[My experiences with take-homes\\] drive home the idea that this employer doesn't care if you are a carbon-based life form, as long as code comes out of one or more of your orifices. Take-home assignments could, in theory, be great for both companies and candidates. What better, fairer way to evaluate someone’s ability to do the work… than to have them do the work? Unfortunately, in practice, take-homes typically suck for engineers. We surveyed almost 700 of our users about their experiences with take-homes and interviewed a handful more for deeper insights. We learned a lot—mostly about candidates' poor experiences and negative feelings toward take-homes. They take a lot of time. They don’t respect candidates’ time. Candidates often get no feedback. And candidates are almost never compensated. The good news? Turns out there are some pretty simple things companies can do to vastly improve their take-home assignments. But before we dive into that… Why do companies use take-home assignments? Take-homes vary a ton by role and company in terms of the types of questions, subject matter, length, and intensity. At their simplest, take-homes can be the same questions as in an algorithmic interview, except done asynchronously. The other extreme is asking candidates to build an entire app and deploy it. We were surprised to see how often companies use take-homes. About 85% of our users got one at some point in their career, independent of their experience level. Of the users who encountered them, they tended to see them as part of the process about 20% of the time, again, independent of their experience level1. Why are take-homes relatively popular among employers? They mostly use them to save time in the hiring process. There are, however, some more noble reasons a company might use a take-home assignment: Get better signal during the interview process, as a take-home can be more indicative of actual work Get a candidate's best work out of them in a lower-stress environment than a live algorithmic interview and/or attract candidates who don’t like algorithmic interviews (of which there are plenty) Broaden the candidate pool by offering a way in for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds—in lieu of a resume screen, which they’d likely fail, candidates can do choose to do an assignment Accordingly, here’s the relevant part of a great conversation between Vincent Woo of CoderPad and Patrick McKenzie (known to Hacker News folks as patio11) of Stripe, formerly of Starfighter. Vincent: What general sort of high level change do you think that recruiters at tech companies that are roughly Stripe’s size or bigger ought to make? Patrick: If I could wave a magic wand and sell the world on one concept, it would be selling the world on the desirability of work sample testing… where the way to tell if someone is good at something is to have them do the something. Despite enthusiasm for the theory of take-homes and some very well-intentioned reasons, candidates overwhelmingly don’t like take-homes. Here’s why. Why don’t candidates like take-homes? It’s about value asymmetry. Though users expressed a lot of frustration with take-homes, we were surprised to see very few take a hard-line stance and refuse to do them. Only 6% outright refuse, and 66% of people complete take-homes all or most of the time. Surprisingly, these stats didn’t really change when we looked only at senior engineers. I was expecting that experienced engineers would do them almost never, if at all, but that’s not what the data shows. It’s possible that seniors are just louder in their disapproval. Nevertheless, the more desirable a company, the more likely candidates will do the take-home and feel OK about it—70% told us they completed them because they “Really wanted to work at the company and were willing to do what it took.” I found Weedmaps \\[to be\\] a very interesting company. They were the first marijuana related company to IPO. So you'd be on the frontier working for them. I found that exciting. So I applied and they had \\[a\\] take-home. I was like, sure, of course I’ll do this. Other reasons our users gave for completion included: “Because the take-home would be discussed at the onsite” (38%) and “Interesting/cool assignment” (37%). However, many of those who did finish them had such a poor experience that they said they’d never apply to certain companies ever again. We’ll talk about what makes the experience poor in a little bit. Of the people who refused to do at least one take-home at some point in their career, here were their reasons. Numbers don’t add up to 100 because it was a multi-select poll. In addition, we obviously don’t know how often take-homes are boring or unclear in the wild (probably often!), nor do we know how often companies pay people to do them (our guess, based on some napkin math, is >10% of the time). So we don’t have the true denominator for these stats. Nevertheless, we found these results insightful. The common thread among all of these reasons is value asymmetry. The worst take-homes feel unrewarding to candidates. Even exploitative. Take-home assignments ask a lot of candidates: a significant investment of their time, with an often unclear scope, no guarantee of progressing to the next round, often without feedback, and almost always without compensation. Meanwhile, the company has basically invested nothing, except to send the task. We heard this a lot. When I'm interviewing, I look for things that are proxies for valuing team members… or not. If they want me to do a take-home test, and they haven't even spent 30 minutes on a phone screen, I begin to sense an asymmetry in our relationship, with their time and resources being very valuable, and mine not being valuable at all. A divergence between how much effort they want me to put in, and how much they want to put in themselves. It signals that they are more worried about their time than mine, their costs than mine. It also means they underestimate how much effort it takes to write code, so that if I go to work for them, I am likely to face demands to work uncompensated overtime to meet their optimistic estimates. Spending five hours on their one-hour test for nothing leaves hard feelings. And if they ghost me after the test, I will happily tell every developer who asks what cheapskates they are. Is there any relationship between who candidates are and their willingness to do take-homes? Perhaps surprisingly, our data says no. We ran a regression to compare our survey respondents’ interview performance on our platform to how likely they were to do take-homes. The relationship was so weak as to be negligible. Similarly, we ran a regression to see if people who look good on paper are more or less likely to do take-homes. The relationship there was negligible as well. In other words, contrary to some popular opinions, you’re not necessarily weeding out your best candidates by doing take-homes, whether you define “best” in terms of how their resume looks or how they perform in interviews. How companies can make take-homes better (and why they probably should) After reading the stats above, you might think that, despite their grumblings, candidates generally do take-homes, and the best candidates won’t be weeded out. So, if you’re one of the many companies that uses them, it may not make sense to invest your limited time into making them better. It’s not that simple. For some companies, like the FAANGs, who have extremely strong brands and are known to pay well, changes are probably not worth it, especially in this market, where junior and senior engineers are willing to jump through more hoops than ever before. If you’re not a FAANG, though, listen up. Here are some questions you can ask yourself to figure out if you should indeed make some changes to your take-homes. First, take an honest look in the mirror and ask yourself about your brand strength. Are you a household name? Does having you on candidates’ resumes give them automatic prestige? Are you known to pay above market? If the answer to all of these questions isn’t a resounding yes, your brand strength is probably not strong enough to make people jump through hoops. Here’s a sketch to drive that point home. Unless you have a ton of brand strength, candidates’ willingness to jump through hoops drops off sharply. In fairness, I drew this sketch in a boom market. Maybe it’s a bit less steep now, but honestly, I’m not sure. If you aren’t maxing out on brand strength, there are two questions you should ask yourself: What is my take-home completion rate? What is my offer acceptance rate? If your completion rate is below, say, 60% (our data shows that candidates complete take-homes around 62% of the time), then it’s DEFINITELY time to make a change. Honestly, regardless of what our data says, if people aren’t completing them at least 85% of the time, it’s probably time to make a change—losing more than 15% of your candidates to attrition at any given stage in the funnel is bad. What about your offer acceptance rate? If it’s less than 50% and you’re using a take-home already, there’s an opportunity to make some improvements. You might be wondering what this has to do with take-homes in the first place. To answer that, let’s change how we think about different parts of the interview process. At face value, every part of the process is there to vet candidates, to determine if they’re the right fit for your organization. However, when used correctly, every part of your process should become a selling vehicle as well. This is especially important for companies who do not have a strong, well-known brand. The FAANGs can get away with using their interview processes primarily as vetting exercises because candidates are already sold on the pay or prestige or sometimes on the work and the product. When you don’t have an established brand, the candidates who come to you are, at best, open to learning more, and the interview process is the instrument that teaches them. Wield it accordingly. Though we strongly advocate coming up with great, unique interview questions2 and making sure you have great interviewers, if your process does have a take-home component, it is one of the more overlooked parts of the process when it comes to selling. You have the opportunity to have someone do the actual work that you do! This is your chance to pick the coolest stuff you’ve worked on and serve it up to someone on a platter and make it stick in their brains and make them imagine what it’d be like to work on these kinds of problems every day! Why wouldn’t you jump at this opportunity? You may think you don’t need to sell in this market. But just because employers have all the power right now, it doesn’t mean that will always be the case. And great senior engineers still have a lot of leverage. If, after considering your take-home completion rate and your offer acceptance rate, it looks like you do need to make some changes, here are some practical tips, based on what we’ve learned from talking to our users (overwhelmingly senior engineers who are targeting top-tier companies—probably the people you want). Let’s start with what we just talked about: using the take-home as a selling vehicle. Make them interesting and relevant to the actual work You're getting a chance to spend a couple of hours with somebody in a take-home (metaphorically). Why wouldn't you do everything you can to get them excited? Pick a problem that you've worked on, and get them hooked on it. Pick the kernel of an interesting problem that you've solved, and build something around it that will challenge candidates. Something that gets them thinking, “I could have done that better” or “This is a different or more efficient way to do it.” That's going to be more effective than the standard perks many companies offer. \\[Best take-home I’ve seen was an\\] open-ended system design question on the type of system I would work on, was meant to simulate a team discussion on the system we needed to build, and was a great way for me to start thinking about what I'd be working on there. One way you could do this, is to have your engineering team keep a shared doc of ‘cool’ solutions they've found, or new things they've tried. These can serve as jumping-off points for creating your take-homes. The… challenge was for an internal tooling team that specialized in incident response tools; their challenge was to create a scaled down version of a tool already in use at the company. The focus was more on understanding the domain and customer than wiring up a bunch of complicated stuff, and it was a delight. It being a greenfield also gave you an opportunity to showcase some software design skills. I did not get this job, but enjoyed the experience and still feel connected to the team. It was conceptually related to the sort of work the team was performing, but it was simplified and stand-alone enough to clearly not be unpaid labor for their product. Just be sure that when you come up with a practical problem that you strip out the annoying parts and focus only on the juicy kernel of the problem, the part that’s actually cool and lets the candidate be smart and creative. Don’t make them do grunt work or wrestle with their dev environment! \\[This\\] was for a tooling team in Support, where they didn't have a lot of experience creating challenges or interviewing. One of the engineers took a difficult task that he had accomplished recently and just made that the take home challenge. It involved a lot of Ruby version conflict debugging. It was completely demoralizing and felt like hazing. Keep them short Candidates overwhelmingly favor take-homes that respect their time, i.e., short ones. The best were short and brief, took no more than 2 hours and were directly related to what I would be doing on the job. Best are realistic and time bound, i.e., low time investment required. Short and quick take-homes are great. Over 80% of survey respondents said that take-homes should take 4 hours or less, and a plurality thought that they should take 2 hours. The outliers are interesting. Unfortunately, we missed an opportunity to ask about those in the survey. Take-homes being short in theory is one thing… but we got a lot of feedback that take-homes often go far beyond how long companies tell candidates that take-homes should take. Have someone on your team QA the actual length of the assignment This disconnect between actual time and expected time is another instance of value asymmetry: companies didn't even bother to have someone on their team do the take-home themselves and time it. I've done a couple of algorithm questions as take-homes that the interviewer said should take an hour. They routinely take longer than that. Companies will say, ‘don’t spend more than X hours on it,’ but then it actually takes 5X that amount. It's just too much time. And most of the time they didn’t give feedback at all even though I spent so much time on it. Companies should clearly communicate the expected time commitment for a take-home. And they should be realistic about how much time it should take. Best was an interesting problem with a realistic time frame. They estimated 2 hours and it took me exactly that, which was refreshing and made the process seem fair. I've done a couple of exercises where they were truly respectful of my time. The tasks were small, clearly defined, and they gave me a realistic timeframe to complete them. For the best take-home I did, the company told me: ‘Tell us when you're going to start, and you'll have 4 hours. We'll be available over email that whole time, and we'll answer your questions within minutes.’ That felt respectful of my time, and was a more reliable signal of my capabilities than a 20-minute algorithms exercise. To get a realistic estimate, companies could simply QA their own take-homes—just by having someone on your team take it, and time them. Still, some candidates will spend more time anyway, because they really want to work for a certain company. And it can be easy for candidates to go down a rabbit hole and get most of a take-home done in the first few hours, then spend another day or more, perfecting it to give themselves a better chance. Do you want me to literally only work two hours on something that's clearly going to take 10 to really be able to have a conversation with you about how I think about things? Because two hours of decisions isn't as good as 10 hours of decisions. It’s okay if candidates want to put in extra time, but it should be made clear that that's not the expectation. Set a clear scope, related to the role The scope was poorly defined, which made the assignment not only tedious, but also seemed like a waste of time. Having clear, straightforward instructions can significantly enhance the take-home experience for candidates, making them feel purposeful and relevant. The best take-homes are those that directly align with the actual job. When candidates are asked to solve a simplified version of a real problem your company is facing, it not only tests relevant skills, but also gives a candidate insight into what work at your company would be like, which is really what selling is. (This is, of course, assuming that you believe what you’re working on is cool… If you don’t, how will you ever convince others?) One was a great learning experience because I had to solve a problem similar to what I would face in the job. It was concise and focused. Being able to ask questions before or during the take-home, e.g., having a direct contact point who’s an engineer at the company, can also be a big plus. Be thoughtful about where in your process you insert the take-home, and give candidates a choice between a take-home and something else For take-homes early in the process, before speaking to a human We expect that many of the companies reading this piece have take-homes as the first step in their process, before ever talking to a human. This decision isn’t very popular. If a company calls me for a screening interview, it means they've read my resume and cover letter, and not immediately dismissed my application as inappropriate. It also means they're putting a person on a phone call with me for the duration of the screening interview. This is symmetric, my effort matches theirs. \\[I\\] did a take home that was automatically sent to me after applying, before even speaking to a human. The feedback was 'you are too expensive,' no feedback on the coding. Company needs to build an investment with the candidate first—they shouldn't ask for it before meeting the candidate at least once. That said, take-homes can be a great way to let candidates who don’t look good on paper show what they can do, and those candidates are more likely to complete them. To prevent candidate unhappiness/attrition, give them a choice. Either submit a resume or do the take-home assignment or both. If you go this route, though, design a take-home that you trust. We’ve seen companies take this approach and then throw out perfect-scoring take-homes when they didn’t like the resume. If you use a take-home, then respect your candidates enough to follow up with the ones who’ve done well, even if they don’t look good on paper. For take-homes later in the process Another way to make take-homes purposeful is to give your candidates an explicit choice about whether they’d rather do a technical interview or a take-home. Engineers are, in fact, split on which they’d prefer. Giving them a choice allows them to showcase their skills in the format they prefer and feel best prepared for. If you have good questions, you should be able to get good signal from either. Only 10% of respondents told us that they were given the choice of take-home versus technical interview. So there is an opportunity for more companies to do this. It's a candidate-friendly gesture that shows empathy and can help candidates shine. Many candidates have spent months preparing for standard technical interviews. So it can feel anticlimactic when they find out that a company they're excited about doesn't do them. Others get so nervous in a live interview that they don’t perform. I rarely don't pass take-home assessments, but I often fail to pass live interviews. Interestingly, one user we interviewed told us that they spend far less time on a take-home compared to preparing for a live technical interview. And because of that they prefer take-homes. I prefer take-homes over all other assessments because I find I spend far less time on take-homes then I do preparing for live interviews. It's hard to overestimate the amount of extra time I spend preparing for a technical interview, compared to doing a take-home—for me it’s maybe 10 times as much. I've spent hundreds of hours, maybe 500 hours, over the course of my career preparing for technical interviews. And if I have one pop up, I can't just drop everything and do it right away. I have to spend a lot of extra time just ramping up for a particular interview, in addition to the hundreds of hours that I've done. Give candidates a good, rational reason to do the take-home Clear communication about the purpose of a take-home in the hiring process, as well as why it’s rational to spend time on it, is important for candidates. It’s a way to make sure it feels purposeful and not like a random task. One way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to replace some parts of your process with it. A standard process without a take-home has a recruiter call followed by a technical phone screen followed by an onsite (virtual or otherwise). The technical phone screen usually lasts about an hour. The onsite usually lasts 6 hours. Let’s say your take-home takes 2 hours to do. You can make it replace the phone screen and one of the onsite rounds, which nets out to the same number of hours spent. If you go this route, we recommend doing the math explicitly for candidates and showing them that the time they spend on the take-home is equivalent to the time they’d be spending on a process without it. Another way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to incorporate it into the onsite, where at least one of the rounds, if not more, will include a code review and/or thoughtful discussion about tradeoffs and choices made. This should be standard practice, but isn’t always. 32% of our users said companies had told them this, and it was the reason they decided to do a take-home. The best take-homes were ones that we discussed in the first rounds of interviews. The worst ones were ones that I submitted and we never talked about them again. Ideally, you do both of these things together, and very clearly explain to candidates both the math and how the take-home informs the content of the onsite. Compensate candidates Probably the most striking result of our survey was that 58% of candidates think that they deserve compensation for completing take-homes. Yet only 4% reported ever receiving it. Compensation can shift candidate perceptions of the hiring process and of the company: They compensated me for my time, which made the process feel very professional and respectful. It was a completely open source codebase and so their process was the exact same as someone that was an employee: here's the ticket with the information to do it, set up the environment, download all the code, get everything running. They gave me a few different tasks I could choose from, I could pick two, and if I completed them I would be compensated a fixed rate, which was $100 for each task. Which in terms of the time I spent on it, is still really cheap for them. If candidates know they’re going to be paid for their work on a take-home, they’ll be more likely to complete it as well. Compensating candidates is a clear gesture that shows you value their time and effort, that there’s more symmetry in the relationship. It also goes hand-in-hand with time: paying also forces a company to scope the take-home to a reasonable number of hours. So it's a forcing function for good behavior—if you can’t afford much, then don't make the take-home too long! How much to pay? Responses about how much companies should pay for take-home assignments were split. Fixed amounts: Just over half of respondents (52%) suggested specific and reasonable fixed amounts, ranging from $50 to $500. Hourly rates: The other almost half (47%) favored an hourly rate, with suggestions ranging from $50 an hour and upward (average of $217 an hour). Some suggested that the rate should correspond to the salary of the position being applied for, or be comparable to what an employee at that level and company would earn. As one user put it: Maybe just pay market? One antipattern when it comes to comp is NOT having a set rate, asking the candidate to name their price, and thereby putting the candidate in a position where they feel like they need to negotiate. In this scenario, the candidate has to negotiate twice: once on the take-home and once on their actual comp, with the worry that negotiating too aggressively on the take-home might count them out… or not aggressively enough anchoring the company to lower compensation down the line. No one needs these mind-games in an already stressful process. Just have a set rate, for god’s sake. Symbolic compensation: This is probably not the best option, but a handful of survey respondents (1%) did mention that a minimal symbolic compensation would do. While 1% is small, we found this interesting to include because, when we interviewed people, two of them mentioned this. I think any compensation at all has symbolic value. A $100 Amazon card would impress me. A $50 Amazon card and a company t-shirt would at least not insult me. It’s kind of a consolation prize to say, ‘No hard feelings.’ I feel like a couple meal vouchers would do it these days. Of these options, we’d recommend a reasonable fixed amount based on the task, and the actual time it’s supposed to take. And of course you know how long it takes because you had one of your engineers do it themselves, right? Right?? Give feedback Lack of feedback was the primary reason our survey respondents said their experience with a given company was bad. Regardless of interview type, we’re always pro feedback, but feedback is especially important for take-homes, because in a way they ask more of a candidate. Offering constructive feedback, regardless of the hiring decision, respects the candidate's effort on the take-home. Despite the time and effort they invested in completing take-homes, many of our survey respondents said they received no feedback at all. This was seen as demoralizing, and it deterred candidates from applying to future opportunities at those companies. Getting rejected without having a chance to discuss the code with anyone is a terrible experience. It is really discouraging spending a large amount of time to find out you are rejected without explanations. They provided no feedback after submission, which made the whole effort feel unappreciated and one-sided. Incidentally, the main reason companies don’t give feedback is fear of getting sued. As it turns out, literally ZERO companies (at least in the US) have ever been sued by an engineer who received constructive post-interview feedback. Thanks to Dan Fennessy for all the behind-the-scenes work on this post.

What better, fairer way to evaluate someone’s ability to do the work… than to have them do the work?\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, in practice, take-homes typically suck for engineers.\\\\n\\\\nWe surveyed almost 700 of our users about their experiences with take-homes and interviewed a handful more for deeper insights. We learned a lot—mostly about candidates' poor experiences and negative feelings toward take-homes. They take a lot of time. They don’t respect candidates’ time. Candidates often get no feedback. And candidates are almost never compensated. \\\\n\\\\nThe good news? Turns out there are some pretty simple things companies can do to vastly improve their take-home assignments. But before we dive into that…\\\\n\\\\n## Why do companies use take-home assignments?\\\\n\\\\nTake-homes vary a ton by role and company in terms of the types of questions, subject matter, length, and intensity. At their simplest, take-homes can be the same questions as in an algorithmic interview, except done asynchronously. The other extreme is asking candidates to build an entire app and deploy it.\\\\n\\\\nWe were surprised to see how often companies use take-homes. About 85% of our users got one at some point in their career, independent of their experience level. Of the users who encountered them, they tended to see them as part of the process about 20% of the time, again, independent of their experience level\\[^1\\]. \\\\n\\\\nWhy are take-homes relatively popular among employers? They mostly use them to save time in the hiring process. There are, however, some more noble reasons a company might use a take-home assignment:\\\\n\\\\n\\* Get better signal during the interview process, as a take-home can be more indicative of actual work \\\\n\\* Get a candidate's best work out of them in a lower-stress environment than a live algorithmic interview and/or attract candidates who don’t like algorithmic interviews (of which there are \\[plenty\\](https://hn.algolia.com/?q=coding+interviews)) \\\\n\\* Broaden the candidate pool by offering a way in for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds—in lieu of a resume screen, which they’d likely fail, candidates can do choose to do an assignment\\\\n\\\\nAccordingly, here’s the relevant part of a great conversation between Vincent Woo of CoderPad and Patrick McKenzie (known to Hacker News folks as patio11) of Stripe, formerly of \\[Starfighter\\](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2015/03/09/announcing-starfighter/).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003ciframe width=\\\\\"720\\\\\" height=\\\\\"405\\\\\" src=\\\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2AutFcXgKIM?si=3amHzY87yufcg35M\\\\u0026amp;start=1739\\\\\" title=\\\\\"YouTube video player\\\\\" frameborder=\\\\\"0\\\\\" allow=\\\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\\\\" allowfullscreen\\\\u003e\\\\u003c/iframe\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\nVincent: \\*What general sort of high level change do you think that recruiters at tech\\\\ncompanies that are roughly Stripe’s size or bigger ought to make?\\*\\\\n\\\\nPatrick: \\*If I could wave a magic wand and sell the world on one concept, it would be selling the world on the desirability of work sample testing… where the way to tell if someone is good at something is to have them do the something.\\*\\\\n\\\\nDespite enthusiasm for the theory of take-homes and some very well-intentioned reasons, candidates overwhelmingly don’t like take-homes. Here’s why.\\\\n\\\\n## Why don’t candidates like take-homes? It’s about value asymmetry.\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Though users expressed a lot of frustration with take-homes, we were surprised to see very few take a hard-line stance and refuse to do them. Only 6% outright refuse, and 66% of people complete take-homes all or most of the time.\\*\\* Surprisingly, these stats didn’t really change when we looked only at senior engineers. I was expecting that experienced engineers would do them almost never, if at all, but that’s not what the data shows. It’s possible that seniors are just louder in their disapproval.\\\\n\\\\n!\\[How often people do take-homes.png\\](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/How\\_often\\_people\\_do\\_take\\_homes\\_e85d712b9b.png)\\\\n\\\\nNevertheless, the more desirable a company, the more likely candidates will do the take-home and feel OK about it—70% told us they completed them because they “Really wanted to work at the company and were willing to do what it took.”\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*I found Weedmaps \\[to be\\] a very interesting company. They were the first marijuana related company to IPO. So you'd be on the frontier working for them. I found that exciting. So I applied and they had \\[a\\] take-home. I was like, sure, of course I’ll do this.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nOther reasons our users gave for completion included: “Because the take-home would be discussed at the onsite” (38%) and “Interesting/cool assignment” (37%). However, many of those who did finish them had such a poor experience that they said they’d never apply to certain companies ever again. We’ll talk about what makes the experience poor in a little bit.\\\\n\\\\nOf the people who refused to do at least one take-home at some point in their career, here were their reasons.\\\\n\\\\n::iio-image{alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" caption=\\\\\"Numbers don’t add up to 100 because it was a multi-select poll. In addition, we obviously don’t know how often take-homes are boring or unclear in the wild (probably often!), nor do we know how often companies pay people to do them (our guess, based on some napkin math, is \\\\u003e10% of the time). So we don’t have the true denominator for these stats. Nevertheless, we found these results insightful.\\\\\" height=\\\\\"600\\\\\" src=\\\\\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Why\\_people\\_don\\_t\\_do\\_take\\_homes\\_f138c44568.png\\\\\" title=\\\\\"\\\\\" width=\\\\\"600\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*The common thread among all of these reasons is value asymmetry.\\*\\* The worst take-homes feel unrewarding to candidates. Even exploitative. Take-home assignments ask a lot of candidates: a significant investment of their time, with an often unclear scope, no guarantee of progressing to the next round, often without feedback, and almost always without compensation. Meanwhile, the company has basically invested nothing, except to send the task. We heard this a lot.\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*When I'm interviewing, I look for things that are proxies for valuing team members… or not. If they want me to do a take-home test, and they haven't even spent 30 minutes on a phone screen, I begin to sense an asymmetry in our relationship, with their time and resources being very valuable, and mine not being valuable at all.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*A divergence between how much effort they want me to put in, and how much they want to put in themselves. It signals that they are more worried about their time than mine, their costs than mine. It also means they underestimate how much effort it takes to write code, so that if I go to work for them, I am likely to face demands to work uncompensated overtime to meet their optimistic estimates.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*Spending five hours on their one-hour test for nothing leaves hard feelings. And if they ghost me after the test, I will happily tell every developer who asks what cheapskates they are.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n## Is there any relationship between who candidates are and their willingness to do take-homes?\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps surprisingly, our data says no. We ran a regression to compare our survey respondents’ interview performance on our platform to how likely they were to do take-homes. The relationship was so weak as to be negligible.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, we ran a regression to see if people who \\_look\\_ good on paper are more or less likely to do take-homes. The relationship there was negligible as well.\\\\n\\\\nIn other words, contrary to some popular opinions, you’re not necessarily weeding out your best candidates by doing take-homes, whether you define “best” in terms of how their resume looks or how they perform in interviews.\\\\n\\\\n## How companies can make take-homes better (and why they probably should)\\\\n\\\\nAfter reading the stats above, you might think that, despite their grumblings, candidates generally do take-homes, and the best candidates won’t be weeded out. So, if you’re one of the many companies that uses them, it may not make sense to invest your limited time into making them better. It’s not that simple. For some companies, like the FAANGs, who have extremely strong brands and are known to pay well, changes are probably not worth it, especially in this market, where junior and senior engineers are willing to jump through more hoops than ever before.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re not a FAANG, though, listen up. Here are some questions you can ask yourself to figure out if you should indeed make some changes to your take-homes.\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*First, take an honest look in the mirror and ask yourself about your brand strength. Are you a household name? Does having you on candidates’ resumes give them automatic prestige? Are you known to pay above market?\\*\\* If the answer to \\_all\\_ of these questions isn’t a resounding yes, your brand strength is probably not strong enough to make people jump through hoops.\\\\n\\\\nHere’s a sketch to drive that point home. Unless you have a ton of brand strength, candidates’ willingness to jump through hoops drops off sharply.\\\\n\\\\n::iio-image{alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" caption=\\\\\"In fairness, I drew this sketch in a boom market. Maybe it’s a bit less steep now, but honestly, I’m not sure.\\\\\" height=\\\\\"600\\\\\" src=\\\\\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brand\\_strength\\_vs\\_value\\_asymmetry\\_4bc96b83d4.png\\\\\" title=\\\\\"\\\\\" width=\\\\\"600\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\nIf you aren’t maxing out on brand strength, there are two questions you should ask yourself: \\\\n\\\\n1. What is my take-home completion rate? \\\\n2. What is my offer acceptance rate? \\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*If your completion rate is below, say, 60% (our data shows that candidates complete take-homes around 62% of the time), then it’s DEFINITELY time to make a change.\\*\\* Honestly, regardless of what our data says, if people aren’t completing them at least 85% of the time, it’s \\_probably\\_ time to make a change—losing more than 15% of your candidates to attrition at any given stage in the funnel is bad.\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*What about your offer acceptance rate? If it’s less than 50% and you’re using a take-home already, there’s an opportunity to make some improvements.\\*\\* You might be wondering what this has to do with take-homes in the first place. To answer that, let’s change how we think about different parts of the interview process. At face value, every part of the process is there to vet candidates, to determine if they’re the right fit for your organization. However, when used correctly, every part of your process should become a selling vehicle as well. This is \\_especially\\_ important for companies who do not have a strong, well-known brand. The FAANGs can get away with using their interview processes primarily as vetting exercises because candidates are already sold on the pay or prestige or sometimes on the work and the product. When you don’t have an established brand, the candidates who come to you are, at best, open to learning more, and the interview process is the instrument that teaches them. Wield it accordingly. \\\\n\\\\nThough we strongly advocate coming up with \\[great, unique interview questions\\](https://interviewing.io/blog/best-technical-interviews-common)\\[^2\\] and making sure you have \\[great interviewers\\](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-have-the-best-technical-interviewers-heres-how-we-do-it), if your process does have a take-home component, it is one of the more overlooked parts of the process when it comes to selling. You have the opportunity to have someone \\_do the actual work that you do\\_! This is your chance to pick the coolest stuff you’ve worked on and serve it up to someone on a platter and make it stick in their brains and make them imagine what it’d be like to work on these kinds of problems every day! Why wouldn’t you jump at this opportunity? \\\\n\\\\nYou may think you don’t need to sell in this market. But just because employers have all the power right now, it doesn’t mean that will always be the case. And great senior engineers still have a lot of leverage. \\\\n\\\\nIf, after considering your take-home completion rate and your offer acceptance rate, it looks like you \\_do\\_ need to make some changes, here are some practical tips, based on what we’ve learned from talking to our users (overwhelmingly senior engineers who are targeting top-tier companies—probably the people you want). Let’s start with what we just talked about: using the take-home as a selling vehicle. \\\\n\\\\n### Make them interesting and relevant to the actual work\\\\n\\\\nYou're getting a chance to spend a couple of hours with somebody in a take-home (metaphorically). Why wouldn't you do everything you can to get them excited? \\*\\*Pick a problem that you've worked on, and get them hooked on it. Pick the kernel of an interesting problem that you've solved, and build something around it that will challenge candidates. Something that gets them thinking, “I could have done that better” or “This is a different or more efficient way to do it.” That's going to be more effective than the standard perks many companies offer.\\*\\* \\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\[Best take-home I’ve seen was an\\] open-ended system design question on the type of system I would work on, was meant to simulate a team discussion on the system we needed to build, and was a great way for me to start thinking about what I'd be working on there.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nOne way you could do this, is to have your engineering team keep a shared doc of ‘cool’ solutions they've found, or new things they've tried. These can serve as jumping-off points for creating your take-homes.\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*The… challenge was for an internal tooling team that specialized in incident response tools; their challenge was to create a scaled down version of a tool already in use at the company. The focus was more on understanding the domain and customer than wiring up a bunch of complicated stuff, and it was a delight. It being a greenfield also gave you an opportunity to showcase some software design skills. I did not get this job, but enjoyed the experience and still feel connected to the team.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*It was conceptually related to the sort of work the team was performing, but it was simplified and stand-alone enough to clearly not be unpaid labor for their product.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nJust be sure that when you come up with a practical problem that you strip out the annoying parts and focus only on the juicy kernel of the problem, the part that’s actually cool and lets the candidate be smart and creative. Don’t make them do grunt work or wrestle with their dev environment!\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\[This\\] was for a tooling team in Support, where they didn't have a lot of experience creating challenges or interviewing. One of the engineers took a difficult task that he had accomplished recently and just made that the take home challenge. It involved a lot of Ruby version conflict debugging. It was completely demoralizing and felt like hazing.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n### Keep them short\\\\n\\\\nCandidates overwhelmingly favor take-homes that respect their time, i.e., short ones.\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*The best were short and brief, took no more than 2 hours and were directly related to what I would be doing on the job.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Best are realistic and time bound, i.e., low time investment required.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Short and quick take-homes are great.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Over 80% of survey respondents said that take-homes should take 4 hours or less, and a plurality thought that they should take 2 hours.\\*\\*\\\\n\\\\n::iio-image{alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" caption=\\\\\"The outliers are interesting. Unfortunately, we missed an opportunity to ask about those in the survey.\\\\\" height=\\\\\"600\\\\\" src=\\\\\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/How\\_long\\_engineers\\_think\\_take\\_home\\_assignments\\_should\\_take\\_2a361d8e29.png\\\\\" title=\\\\\"\\\\\" width=\\\\\"600\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\nTake-homes being short in theory is one thing… but we got a lot of feedback that take-homes often go far beyond how long companies tell candidates that take-homes should take.\\\\n\\\\n#### Have someone on your team QA the actual length of the assignment\\\\n\\\\nThis disconnect between actual time and expected time is another instance of value asymmetry: companies didn't even bother to have someone on their team do the take-home themselves and time it.\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*I've done a couple of algorithm questions as take-homes that the interviewer said should take an hour. They routinely take longer than that.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Companies will say, ‘don’t spend more than X hours on it,’ but then it actually takes 5X that amount. It's just too much time. And most of the time they didn’t give feedback at all even though I spent so much time on it.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nCompanies should clearly communicate the expected time commitment for a take-home. And they should be realistic about how much time it should take.\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Best was an interesting problem with a realistic time frame. They estimated 2 hours and it took me exactly that, which was refreshing and made the process seem fair.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*I've done a couple of exercises where they were truly respectful of my time. The tasks were small, clearly defined, and they gave me a realistic timeframe to complete them.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*For the best take-home I did, the company told me: ‘Tell us when you're going to start, and you'll have 4 hours. We'll be available over email that whole time, and we'll answer your questions within minutes.’ That felt respectful of my time, and was a more reliable signal of my capabilities than a 20-minute algorithms exercise.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*To get a realistic estimate, companies could simply QA their own take-homes—just by having someone on your team take it, and time them.\\*\\*\\\\n\\\\nStill, some candidates will spend more time anyway, because they really want to work for a certain company. And it can be easy for candidates to go down a rabbit hole and get most of a take-home done in the first few hours, then spend another day or more, perfecting it to give themselves a better chance.\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Do you want me to literally only work two hours on something that's clearly going to take 10 to really be able to have a conversation with you about how I think about things? Because two hours of decisions isn't as good as 10 hours of decisions.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\nIt’s okay if candidates want to put in extra time, but it should be made clear that that's not the expectation. \\\\n\\\\n### Set a clear scope, related to the role\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*The scope was poorly defined, which made the assignment not only tedious, but also seemed like a waste of time.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Having clear, straightforward instructions can significantly enhance the take-home experience for candidates, making them feel purposeful and relevant. The best take-homes are those that directly align with the actual job.\\*\\* When candidates are asked to solve a simplified version of a real problem your company is facing, it not only tests relevant skills, but also gives a candidate insight into what work at your company would be like, which is really what selling is. (This is, of course, assuming that you believe what you’re working on is cool… If you don’t, how will you ever convince others?)\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*One was a great learning experience because I had to solve a problem similar to what I would face in the job. It was concise and focused.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nBeing able to ask questions before or during the take-home, e.g., having a direct contact point who’s an engineer at the company, can also be a big plus.\\\\n\\\\n### Be thoughtful about where in your process you insert the take-home, and give candidates a choice between a take-home and something else\\\\n\\\\n#### For take-homes early in the process, before speaking to a human\\\\n\\\\nWe expect that many of the companies reading this piece have take-homes as the first step in \\\\ntheir process, before ever talking to a human. This decision isn’t very popular.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003e\\*If a company calls me for a screening interview, it means they've read my resume and cover letter, and not immediately dismissed my application as inappropriate. It also means they're putting a person on a phone call with me for the duration of the screening interview. This is symmetric, my effort matches theirs.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*\\[I\\] did a take home that was automatically sent to me after applying, before even speaking to a human. The feedback was 'you are too expensive,' no feedback on the coding.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Company needs to build an investment with the candidate first—they shouldn't ask for it before meeting the candidate at least once.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*That said, take-homes can be a great way to let candidates who don’t look good on paper show what they can do, and those candidates are more likely to complete them.\\*\\* To prevent candidate unhappiness/attrition, give them a choice. Either submit a resume or do the take-home assignment or both. If you go this route, though, design a take-home that you trust. We’ve seen companies take this approach and then throw out perfect-scoring take-homes when they didn’t like the resume. If you use a take-home, then respect your candidates enough to follow up with the ones who’ve done well, even if they don’t look good on paper. \\\\n\\\\n#### For take-homes later in the process\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Another way to make take-homes purposeful is to give your candidates an explicit choice about whether they’d rather do a technical interview or a take-home.\\*\\* Engineers are, in fact, split on which they’d prefer. Giving them a choice allows them to showcase their skills in the format they prefer and feel best prepared for. If you have good questions, you should be able to get good signal from either. \\\\n\\\\nOnly 10% of respondents told us that they were given the choice of take-home versus technical interview. So there is an opportunity for more companies to do this. It's a candidate-friendly gesture that shows empathy and can help candidates shine.\\\\n\\\\nMany candidates have spent months preparing for standard technical interviews. So it can feel anticlimactic when they find out that a company they're excited about doesn't do them. Others get so nervous in a live interview that they don’t perform.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003e\\*I rarely don't pass take-home assessments, but I often fail to pass live interviews.\\*\\\\n\\\\nInterestingly, one user we interviewed told us that they spend far less time on a take-home compared to preparing for a live technical interview. And because of that they prefer take-homes.\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*I prefer take-homes over all other assessments because I find I spend far less time on take-homes then I do preparing for live interviews. It's hard to overestimate the amount of extra time I spend preparing for a technical interview, compared to doing a take-home—for me it’s maybe 10 times as much. I've spent hundreds of hours, maybe 500 hours, over the course of my career preparing for technical interviews. And if I have one pop up, I can't just drop everything and do it right away. I have to spend a lot of extra time just ramping up for a particular interview, in addition to the hundreds of hours that I've done.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n### Give candidates a good, rational reason to do the take-home\\\\n\\\\nClear communication about the purpose of a take-home in the hiring process, as well as why it’s rational to spend time on it, is important for candidates. It’s a way to make sure it feels purposeful and not like a random task.\\\\n\\\\nOne way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to replace some parts of your process with it. A standard process without a take-home has a recruiter call followed by a technical phone screen followed by an onsite (virtual or otherwise). The technical phone screen usually lasts about an hour. The onsite usually lasts 6 hours.\\\\n\\\\nLet’s say your take-home takes 2 hours to do. You can make it replace the phone screen and one of the onsite rounds, which nets out to the same number of hours spent. If you go this route, we recommend doing the math \\_explicitly\\_ for candidates and showing them that the time they spend on the take-home is equivalent to the time they’d be spending on a process without it.\\\\n\\\\nAnother way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to incorporate it into the onsite, where at least one of the rounds, if not more, will include a code review and/or thoughtful discussion about tradeoffs and choices made. This should be standard practice, but isn’t always. 32% of our users said companies had told them this, and it was the reason they decided to do a take-home.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003e\\*The best take-homes were ones that we discussed in the first rounds of interviews. The worst ones were ones that I submitted and we never talked about them again.\\*\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Ideally, you do both of these things together, and very clearly explain to candidates both the math and how the take-home informs the content of the onsite.\\*\\*\\\\n\\\\n### Compensate candidates\\\\n\\\\nProbably the most striking result of our survey was that 58% of candidates think that they deserve compensation for completing take-homes. Yet only 4% reported ever receiving it. Compensation can shift candidate perceptions of the hiring process and of the company: \\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*They compensated me for my time, which made the process feel very professional and respectful.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*It was a completely open source codebase and so their process was the exact same as someone that was an employee: here's the ticket with the information to do it, set up the environment, download all the code, get everything running. They gave me a few different tasks I could choose from, I could pick two, and if I completed them I would be compensated a fixed rate, which was $100 for each task. Which in terms of the time I spent on it, is still really cheap for them.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nIf candidates know they’re going to be paid for their work on a take-home, they’ll be more likely to complete it as well.\\\\nCompensating candidates is a clear gesture that shows you value their time and effort, that there’s more symmetry in the relationship. It also goes hand-in-hand with time: paying also forces a company to scope the take-home to a reasonable number of hours. So it's a forcing function for good behavior—if you can’t afford much, then don't make the take-home too long!\\\\n\\\\n#### How much to pay?\\\\n\\\\nResponses about how much companies should pay for take-home assignments were split.\\\\n\\\\n1. \\*\\*Fixed amounts\\*\\*: Just over half of respondents (52%) suggested specific and reasonable fixed amounts, ranging from $50 to $500. \\\\n\\\\n2. \\*\\*Hourly rates\\*\\*: The other almost half (47%) favored an hourly rate, with suggestions ranging from $50 an hour and upward (average of $217 an hour). Some suggested that the rate should correspond to the salary of the position being applied for, or be comparable to what an employee at that level and company would earn. As one user put it: \\\\n\\\\n \\\\u003e\\*Maybe just pay market?\\*\\\\n\\\\n One antipattern when it comes to comp is NOT having a set rate, asking the candidate to name their price, and thereby putting the candidate in a position where they feel like they need to negotiate. In this scenario, the candidate has to negotiate twice: once on the take-home and once on their actual comp, with the worry that negotiating too aggressively on the take-home might count them out… or not aggressively enough anchoring the company to lower compensation down the line. No one needs these mind-games in an already stressful process. Just have a set rate, for god’s sake.\\\\n\\\\n3. \\*\\*Symbolic compensation\\*\\*: This is probably not the best option, but a handful of survey respondents (1%) did mention that a minimal symbolic compensation would do. While 1% is small, we found this interesting to include because, when we interviewed people, two of them mentioned this.\\\\n\\\\n :::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n \\*I think any compensation at all has symbolic value. A $100 Amazon card would impress me. A $50 Amazon card and a company t-shirt would at least not insult me. It’s kind of a consolation prize to say, ‘No hard feelings.’\\*\\\\n :::\\\\n :::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n \\*I feel like a couple meal vouchers would do it these days.\\*\\\\n :::\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Of these options, we’d recommend a reasonable fixed amount based on the task, and the actual time it’s supposed to take.\\*\\* And of course you know how long it takes because you had one of your engineers do it themselves, right? Right??\\\\n\\\\n### Give feedback\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Lack of feedback was the primary reason our survey respondents said their experience with a given company was bad.\\*\\* Regardless of interview type, we’re always \\[pro feedback\\](https://interviewing.io/blog/why-giving-feedback-good-or-bad-will-help-you-hire), but feedback is especially important for take-homes, because in a way they ask more of a candidate. Offering constructive feedback, regardless of the hiring decision, respects the candidate's effort on the take-home.\\\\n\\\\nDespite the time and effort they invested in completing take-homes, many of our survey respondents said they received no feedback at all. This was seen as demoralizing, and it deterred candidates from applying to future opportunities at those companies.\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Getting rejected without having a chance to discuss the code with anyone is a terrible experience.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*It is really discouraging spending a large amount of time to find out you are rejected without explanations.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*They provided no feedback after submission, which made the whole effort feel unappreciated and one-sided.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nIncidentally, the main reason companies don’t give feedback is fear of getting sued. As it turns out, \\[literally ZERO companies (at least in the US) have ever been sued by an engineer\\](https://interviewing.io/blog/no-engineer-has-ever-sued-a-company-because-of-constructive-post-interview-feedback-so-why-dont-employers-do-it) who received constructive post-interview feedback.\\\\n\\\\n\\_Thanks to \\[Dan Fennessy\\](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielfennessy/) for all the behind-the-scenes work on this post.\\_\\\\n\\\\nFootnotes:\\\\n\\\\n\\[^1\\]: Some users told us they’re seeing take-homes more recently, likely a function of worsening market conditions—the less leverage talent has, the more hoops companies can ask them to jump through.\\\\n\\[^2\\]: You might have to do this soon anyway, in all your interviews, to \\[ward off against AI-driven cheating\\](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-hard-is-it-to-cheat-with-chatgpt-in-technical-interviews).\\\\n\",\"excerpt\":\"We surveyed almost 700 of our users about their experiences with take-homes and interviewed a handful more for deeper insights.

          "content": "Footnotes Participating technical recruiters were paid a base rate and then received additional $$ for each accurate prediction. ↩ Different roles have different requirements. To correct for that, we asked each candidate to specify which eng role they were applying for: Software Engineer (back-end or full-stack), Mobile Engineer, Front-end Engineer, ML Engineer, Data Engineer, or Engineering Manager. Then we prompted recruiters to evaluate them specifically for that role. If no role was specified by the candidate, the default role to evaluate for was Software Engineer (back-end or full-stack). ↩ Top firms = Airbnb, Amazon, Anthropic, AWS, Apple, Asana, Atlassian, Bloomberg LP, Checkr, Coinbase, Coursera, Cruise, Dropbox, Etsy, Facebook, Flexport, GitHub, Google, Gusto, HashiCorp, Instacart, Instagram, Jane Street, Jump Trading, Khan Academy, LinkedIn, Lyft, Medium, Microsoft, Mozilla, Netflix, Oculus, OpenAI, Palantir, Peloton, Pinterest, Postmates, Quora, Reddit, Robinhood, Roblox, Salesforce, Segment, Slack, Snap, Snowflake, SpaceX, Spotify, Square, Stripe, Tesla, Thumbtack, TikTok, Twilio, Twitch, Twitter, Two Sigma, Uber, Udemy, Waymo, Whatsapp, Yelp, and Zoom. ↩ We corrected by FAANG & FAANG-adjacent experience (and all of our other variables) before making this statement, i.e., the effect existed for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds who did not have FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies on their resumes. We expect that recruiters favor underrepresented minority candidates because of guidelines from their employers to focus on sourcing these types of candidates, as part of DEI initiatives. Discussion about the magnitude of this effect and its implications is out of scope of this piece. ↩ Interestingly, recruiters might penalize, for example, alternative education. Candidates with only alternative education pathways post-high school — coding bootcamps or digital certifications — appeared to be penalized by recruiters in this study. However, with limited observations (n=11), it’s inconclusive without further study. ↩ That field was optional, so most of the reasons recruiters provided were in cases when they said no — presumably because the reasons for saying yes may have seemed self-evident. ↩ It’s not that recruiters who generally take their time make more accurate judgements. Any recruiter slowing down might make them better at judging resumes! ↩ It’s important to stress that neither algorithm was custom-built. The models, one using a Random Forest algorithm and the other an XGBoost algorithm, are distinct but interrelated approaches akin to Decision Tree algorithms. Decision trees sort data into groups based on features. Random forest algorithms combine multiple decision trees to improve predictions. XGBoost builds multiple decision trees one after another, with each new tree focusing on prediction errors from the previous trees. ↩ Training data excluded data in this study. We take user privacy very seriously, and we want to stress that all models were local and anonymized and that no data in this study was shared with cloud LLMs. ↩ To see a particularly egregious example of recruiters favoring brands over substance, take a close look at this fake resume that got a bunch of recruiter responses. And this one too. ↩ We haven’t proven causality here, but when we just scoped our analysis to the same person, it appeared that taking more time did help (in other words, it’s not just that recruiters who spend more time usually are more accurate; it’s the added time). Still, this is something that merits more work, and we'll try to investigate it causally in the future. ↩",

          "title": "The unwritten rules (till now) of negotiating with Meta",
          "content": "Footnotes How team matching works changed fairly recently. In the past, you’d get an offer before you matched with a team and do a 6-week “bootcamp” where you’d get up to speed on Meta’s tech stack, infrastructure, and systems, followed by a multi-week “speed dating”-esque team matching cycle. Bootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter (2-4 weeks), and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers continue to ramp up on their specific teams. ↩ We’ve recently heard that Meta may now be insisting that team matching conversations happen in serial, i.e., you can only do one at a time. However, this doesn’t meaningfully change our advice. ↩ You might say, “Aline, why can’t I just make up offers?” We could never, in good conscience, advise that. It’s unethical, and though I’d argue that while Meta’s negotiation practices are also unethical, that’s not the way to win. Outside of ethical considerations, while the risks of getting caught are low, they’re not zero. Lying about offers, in our mind, is the last refuge of the incompetent. ↩ The advice in this post is orthogonal from your career goals and what you want to work on. This blog post is about navigating an unfair system filled with opaque rules while maximizing your cash. It is not about self-actualization, though we’d argue that creating the most optionality for yourself helps with self-actualization as well. You can also talk to smaller companies and use your big-co offers as leverage to increase your startup equity. There’s nothing wrong with that, but more detail on optionality and self-actualization is outside the scope of this post. ↩ Of course, some hiring managers will use high-pressure sales tactics or create false timelines to try to close you. But that’s the exception rather than the rule. You can decide if that’s something that you want to weigh when judging whether or not you want to work for them. ↩ We strongly urge you to avoid negotiating over the phone and over text, whenever possible. Your recruiter does 5 of these calls a day. You might do one of these calls every few years. Do the hard part over email. It’s the best way to level the playing field. Read this post to learn how to avoid synchronous phone negotiations (just look for “phone”). ↩ One advanced maneuver is to pit all your other companies against each other and raise up their initial offers BEFORE talking to Meta. We’ll likely write about how to run this play in a future post. ↩",

In two instances, the interviewee was familiar with the question and chose to solve the problem themselves. In one interview, the interviewee wanted to just try the question on their own and didn't prompt ChatGPT, ignoring our instructions. The last two interviews were \"custom\" interview questions that were problematic for reasons we’ll outline later in this article. ↩ This is a higher passthrough rate than you'd see in the wild. We think it comes down to two factors: selection bias and pre-interview prep. The users who invest in interview prep are a specific, self-selected slice of the population. Moreover, many of our users practice on their own before practicing with a human. ↩",

Most people overestimated the number by an order of magnitude. Here's what we did to get to the actual number.Read more >You now need to do 15% better in technical interviews than you did at the start of 2022 (and the bar will keep rising).By Aline Lerner | Published: December 1, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024interviewing.io is a technical mock interview platform and technical recruiting marketplace, so we have a ton of useful data around technical interviewing and hiring. One of the most useful pieces of data in the current climate is the ever-changing technical interview bar – throughout 2022, it’s gotten progressively harder to pass technical interviews, and it’s only going to keep getting harder. We crunched the numbers and came up with a running index that quantifies where the eng bar will be, as a function of open tech jobs. The bar is clearly going up.Read more >How much have 2022 layoffs affected engineers vs. other departments? We dug into the data to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: October 13, 2022; Last updated: December 7, 2024Over the past few months, I’ve seen a number of fear-mongering pieces in the press about how the recession is driving tech layoffs and how tech employees (and engineers specifically) are losing their leverage as a result. The problem is that “tech” can mean anyone working at a tech company. You’re an engineer? Of course, you’re tech. You do ops? Great, you’re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn’t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It’s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that “tech” refers to engineers specifically. I don’t like imprecision, and I really don’t like fear-mongering. So, we at interviewing.io dug into the data to see if engineers do indeed have a reason to fear.Read more >The definitive list of companies who are hiring engineers right nowBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 20, 2022; Last updated: June 19, 2024interviewing.io is both a mock interview platform and an eng hiring marketplace (engineers use us for technical interview practice, and top performers get fast-tracked at companies), so we have some unique insights into how recent hiring freezes have affected engineers’ behavior. We also have unique insight into which companies are actually hiring. As such, in the spirit of being useful during a hard and uncertain time, we thought it’d be interesting to survey our users to see what’s actually going on in the market. TL;DR There are lots of engineers actively looking. There are also lots of companies who are actively hiring. Read the actual post to see the full list of 447 U.S. companies who are hiring software engineers right now.Read more >What’s actually going on with Google and Facebook hiring freezes? We surveyed 1000 engineers to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: August 1, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024It looks like we’re entering a recession. One of the hardest things about it is the lack of reliable information about whether companies are still hiring and what hiring freezes even mean. Arguably the two most impactful eng hiring freezes were announced by Facebook (May 4, 2022) and then Google (July 20, 2022). Facebook’s freeze is allegedly partial, targeting roles below L7 and excluding machine learning engineers. Google’s freeze is allegedly all-encompassing but may only last 2 weeks. But what’s actually going on? To make some sense of a bunch of contradictory information about Google’s and Facebook’s hiring freezes in the press and on Blind, we decided to ask the people who, outside of Google …Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

To make some sense of a bunch of contradictory information about Google’s and Facebook’s hiring freezes in the press and on Blind, we decided to ask the people who, outside of Google …\",\"image\":{\"data\":{\"id\":88,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Google-appears-to-be-selectively-applying-their-hiring-freeze-depending-on-level.png\",\"alternativeText\":\"Google-appears-to-be-selectively-applying-their-hiring-freeze-depending-on-level.png\",\"caption\":\"Google-appears-to-be-selectively-applying-their-hiring-freeze-depending-on-level.png\",\"width\":979,\"height\":534,\"formats\":{\"small\":{\"ext\":\".png\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/small\\_Google\\_appears\\_to\\_be\\_selectively\\_applying\\_their\\_hiring\\_freeze\\_depending\\_on\\_level\\_811c48f4c3.png\",\"hash\":\"small\\_Google\\_appears\\_to\\_be\\_selectively\\_applying\\_their\\_hiring\\_freeze\\_depending\\_on\\_level\\_811c48f4c3\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"name\":\"small\\_Google-appears-to-be-selectively-applying-their-hiring-freeze-depending-on-level.png\",\"path\":null,\"size\":16.63,\"width\":500,\"height\":273},\"medium\":{\"ext\":\".png\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/medium\\_Google\\_appears\\_to\\_be\\_selectively\\_applying\\_their\\_hiring\\_freeze\\_depending\\_on\\_level\\_811c48f4c3.png\",\"hash\":\"medium\\_Google\\_appears\\_to\\_be\\_selectively\\_applying\\_their\\_hiring\\_freeze\\_depending\\_on\\_level\\_811c48f4c3\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"name\":\"medium\\_Google-appears-to-be-selectively-applying-their-hiring-freeze-depending-on-level.png\",\"path\":null,\"size\":29.74,\"width\":750,\"height\":409},\"thumbnail\":{\"ext\":\".png\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail\\_Google\\_appears\\_to\\_be\\_selectively\\_applying\\_their\\_hiring\\_freeze\\_depending\\_on\\_level\\_811c48f4c3.png\",\"hash\":\"thumbnail\\_Google\\_appears\\_to\\_be\\_selectively\\_applying\\_their\\_hiring\\_freeze\\_depending\\_on\\_level\\_811c48f4c3\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"name\":\"thumbnail\\_Google-appears-to-be-selectively-applying-their-hiring-freeze-depending-on-level.png\",\"path\":null,\"size\":6.62,\"width\":245,\"height\":134}},\"hash\":\"Google\\_appears\\_to\\_be\\_selectively\\_applying\\_their\\_hiring\\_freeze\\_depending\\_on\\_level\\_811c48f4c3\",\"ext\":\".png\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"size\":23.77,\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Google\\_appears\\_to\\_be\\_selectively\\_applying\\_their\\_hiring\\_freeze\\_depending\\_on\\_level\\_811c48f4c3.png\",\"previewUrl\":null,\"provider\":\"aws-s3\",\"provider\\_metadata\":null,\"createdAt\":\"2022-11-02T18:35:05.554Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2022-11-02T18:35:05.554Z\"}}},\"category\":{\"data\":\\[{\"id\":9,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Recession\",\"slug\":\"recession\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-12-12T19:53:50.549Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-10-06T00:04:37.600Z\"}}\\]},\"authors\":{\"data\":\\[{\"id\":1,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Aline Lerner\",\"email\":\"aline@interviewing.io\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-09-27T16:58:49.743Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2022-09-27T16:58:49.743Z\",\"description\":null,\"tag\\_line\":null}}\\]},\"blogPostSEO\":{\"id\":26,\"metaTitle\":null,\"metaDescription\":\"To make sense of all the contradictory info on Google \\\\u0026 Facebook hiring freezes, we surveyed hundreds of engineers who are interviewing there right now.\",\"keywords\":null,\"metaRobots\":null,\"structuredData\":null,\"metaViewport\":null,\"canonicalURL\":null}}}\\],\"categories\":\\[{\"id\":9,\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"recession\",\"name\":\"Recession\"}},{\"id\":10,\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"salary-negotiation\",\"name\":\"Salary negotiation\"}},{\"id\":3,\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"company-news\",\"name\":\"Company News\"}},{\"id\":1,\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"data-deep-dives\",\"name\":\"Data Deep Dives\"}},{\"id\":4,\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"diversity\",\"name\":\"Diversity\"}},{\"id\":6,\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"guest-posts\",\"name\":\"Guest Posts\"}},{\"id\":7,\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"hiring-is-broken\",\"name\":\"Hiring is broken\"}},{\"id\":8,\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"interview-tips\",\"name\":\"Interview tips\"}},{\"id\":5,\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"for-employers-how-to-hire-better\",\"name\":\"For employers, how to hire better\"}}\\],\"mostPopularBlogPosts\":\\[{\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"nine-free-chapters-of-beyond-cracking-the-coding-interview\",\"title\":\"Read nine chapters of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview for free\"}},{\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"we-co-wrote-the-official-sequel-to-cracking-the-coding-interview-introducing-beyond-ctci\",\"title\":\"We co-wrote the official sequel to Cracking the Coding Interview!\"}},{\"attributes\":{\"slug\":\"are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes\",\"title\":\"Are recruiters better than a coin flip at judging resumes?

We’ve seen the same practices with enough candidates, and across enough different titles and positions, that it’s become clear that they are not isolated incidents or a rogue recruiter’s doing but rather a consistent implementation of a deliberate strategy that comes from the top. If you’re negotiating with Meta, you need to know how they operate and understand the unwritten rules of the game. If you do not know the rules, you will fail — long before you even start negotiating.Read more >How to sabotage your salary negotiations efforts before you even startBy Aline Lerner | Published: August 23, 2023; Last updated: September 6, 2024At interviewing.io, we’ve coached hundreds of people through salary negotiation. We’re good at it — our average user gets $50k more in cash, and we have a 94% success rate. Having done this a lot, we’ve seen our users make the same two mistakes, over and over, BEFORE they start working with us. These mistakes are costly and make it harder for us to do our jobs. Both involve how you talk to recruiters at the start of your job search, way before there’s an offer. Even if you never use our service, you should absolutely avoid these mistakes.Read more >Exactly what to say when recruiters ask you to name the first number… and other negotiation word-for-wordsBy Aline Lerner | Published: August 16, 2018; Last updated: November 3, 2024There are a lot of resources out there that talk about salary negotiation but many tend to skew a bit theoretical. In my experience, one of the hardest things about negotiating your salary is knowing what to say in tough, ambiguous situations with a power balance that’s not in your favor. What’s OK? What’s rude? What are the social norms? And so on. Before I started interviewing.io, I’ve worked as a software engineer, an in-house recruiter, and an agency recruiter, so I’ve literally been on all sides of the negotiating table. For the last few years, I’ve been guest-lecturing MIT’s 6.UAT, a class about technical communication for computer science majors. Every semester, negotiation is one …Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

You can find them here. They include: The first seven chapters of the book, covering topics such as why technical interviews are broken, what recruiters won't tell you, why not to spend a lot of time on resumes, and how to get in the door at companies without a referral. Two technical chapters: Sliding Windows and Binary Search. Our new take on Binary Search teaches one template that works for every binary search problem on LeetCode, with only a single-line change you need to remember.

The sequel is fittingly called Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. We cover everything you need to know for today's tougher technical interviews and hiring climate. We have (at least) thirteen new technical topics and over 150 new problems. We’ve also drawn on a decade of hiring data and 100k interviews from interviewing.io to help you get noticed, manage your job search, and negotiate the best possible offer. The book is available now, and purchases come with $50 off on interviewing.io... given that it costs ~$45, it's not a bad deal.Read more >Why we’re pausing our Pay Later ProgramBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 29, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023We recently made the difficult decision to pause our Pay Later Program. In this post, we’ll talk about why we made that call and what we’ll be doing instead to ensure that engineers who can’t afford to pay for practice will still be able to get it. We’ll also explain some things we’ve learned along the way about funnel optimization, some mistakes we made while iterating on this program, and what we’ll do differently when we hopefully unpause it in the future.Read more >Building interviewing.io's collaborative & replayable whiteboard, or making systems design interviews not suckBy Shehbaj Dhillon | Published: September 6, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023During the spring of 2022, I went from being a user of interviewing.io to being one of the engineers on the team. I discovered interviewing.io in 2021 while preparing for my internship interviews, little did I know that I would end up interviewing for interviewing.io via an interview conducted on interviewing.io to receive an internship opportunity at interviewing.io upon passing the said interview. Yes. During my 11 weeks, I solved an important business problem, quadrupled my problem-solving skills, and collaborated with the fantastic folks who built the product made for engineers, by engineers.Read more >Announcing our Pay Later Program: Don’t pay for mock interviews until you get a jobBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 9, 2022; Last updated: June 20, 2023In the wake of COVID, I made a public promise to launch a program where engineers could defer paying for practice until they found a job. Today, we’re making good on that promise by launching our Pay Later Program! With this program, you get instant credits to spend on interview practice and then pay us once you’ve found a job. And if you get a job through our job board, then you don’t have to pay anything…Read more >We’ve raised our Series A!By Aline Lerner | Published: October 19, 2021; Last updated: May 2, 2023I’m really excited to announce that we raised a $10M Series A, led by the fine people at M13. This round of funding is a long time coming. I don’t know what the average company age is when successfully raising an A, but it took us 6 years to get here. It was a long and windy path, and for a little while, we almost died (more on that below), but we’re still here, and we’re so grateful and excited to finally have the resources to do what we’ve always wanted to do: fix hiring, for real. What does “fixing hiring” mean? We believe that the only way to really effect change, is to make …Read more >Announcing the interviewing.io Technical Interview Practice FellowshipBy Aline Lerner | Published: July 20, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io because I was frustrated with how inefficient and unfair hiring was and how much emphasis employers placed on resumes. But the problem is bigger than resumes. We’ve come to learn that interview practice matters just as much. The resume gets you in the door, and your interview performance is what gets you the offer. But, even though technical interviews are hard and scary for everyone — many of our users are senior engineers from FAANG who are terrified of getting back out there and code up the kinds of problems they don’t usually see at work while someone breathes down their neck — interview prep isn’t equitably distributed. This inequity never really …Read more >interviewing.io is finally out of beta. Anonymous technical interview practice for all!By Aline Lerner | Published: June 4, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io 5 years ago. After working as both an engineer and a recruiter, my frustration with how inefficient and unfair hiring had reached a boiling point. What made me especially angry was that despite mounting evidence that resumes are poor predictors of aptitude, employers were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously. In my mind, any great engineer, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to get their foot in the door wherever they choose. So, we set out to build a better system. On interviewing.io, software engineers can book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Facebook, Google, and others, and if …Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

A popular Reddit post suggests you need 700+ questions and a LeetCode rating between 1800-2000 to pass FAANG interviews. Is this really what the data supports? To answer these questions and more, we looked at our users' LeetCode ranks and ratings and tied them back to interview performance on our platform and whether those users worked at FAANG. In this post, we’ll share what we’ve learned.Read more >Are recruiters better than a coin flip at judging resumes? Here's the data.By Aline Lerner and Peter Bergman | Published: May 1, 2024; Last updated: May 20, 2024In partnership with the team at Learning Collider, we ran a study to see how good recruiters were at judging resumes. We asked technical recruiters to review and make judgments about engineers’ resumes, just as they would in their current roles. They answered two questions per resume: Would you interview this candidate? What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview? We ended up with nearly 2,200 evaluations of over 1,000 resumes. We then compared those judgments to how those engineers performed in interviews on our platform. Here's what we learned.Read more >Refuting Bloomberg's analysis: ChatGPT isn't racist. But it is bad at recruiting.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 11, 2024; Last updated: April 17, 2024Bloomberg recently published an article saying ChatGPT has racial bias when evaluating resumes. We re-ran their numbers and saw that they didn't do any statistical significance testing. In other words, there's no evidence of racial bias, at least not in this data set. However, ChatGPT has another kind of bias -- it drastically overestimates the value of top companies and top schools and does non-traditional candidates a disservice as a result.Read more >Want to work from home? That’ll be $46,282.By Elliot Plant | Published: February 14, 2024Software engineering jobs come with a lot of perks. But that doesn’t mean our jobs are perfect. Work requires us to commute, reduces the time we can spend with family, increases our stress levels, and forces us to deal with teammates we don't gel with. And sometimes we work for companies with questionable morals and use technologies we don’t enjoy.  For some of us, it’s worth trading cash for a job that fits into our lives better. But how much cash? To figure this out, we surveyed our users about times they took jobs with lower compensation, why they did it, and how much money they left on the table. We have the numbers!Read more >How hard is it to cheat in technical interviews with ChatGPT? We ran an experiment.By Mike Mroczka | Published: January 31, 2024; Last updated: May 6, 2024Does ChatGPT make it easy to cheat in technical interviews? To find out, we ran an experiment where we instructed interviewees on our platform to use ChatGPT in their interviews, unbeknownst to their interviewers. The results were surprising, but as a preview, know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately.Read more >When is hiring coming back?

But we’d like to brave the scathing mockery of the internets and try anyway! Our courage is bolstered by some useful data we have (both proprietary and gathered from the internet), which we’ll use to guess what will happen in 2024 and to answer the question foremost in many of our minds: When is hiring coming back?Read more >Why AI can’t do hiringBy Aline Lerner | Published: May 16, 2023; Last updated: March 7, 2024The recent exciting and somewhat horrifying inflection point in AI capability tipped me into writing this blog post. I simply don't believe that AI can do hiring. My argument isn't about bias (though bias is a real problem) or that it's technologically impossible. It's just that the training data simply isn't available. Most people believe that if you can somehow combine what's available on LinkedIn, GitHub, and the social graph (who follows whom on Twitter etc.), you'll be able to find the good engineers who are actively looking and also figure out what they want. This is wrong. None of those 3 sources are actually useful. At the end of the day, you can’t use AI for hiring if you don’t have the data. And if you have the data, then you don’t strictly need AI.Read more >Does posting Open To Work on LinkedIn help or hurt?

Does doing so carry a negative signal? And with the recent deluge of layoffs at tech companies, has the meaning of OpenToWork changed? TL;DR It used to be bad. Now, it's not. Moreover, it's clear to us that the people who were laid off in the 2nd half of 2022 and 2023 so far are great... and that, by and large, these layoffs were indeed NOT based on performance.Read more >Why you shouldn’t list certifications on LinkedInBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 14, 2023; Last updated: May 16, 2023People often suggest that interviewing.io should create a certification that our users can post on their LinkedIn profile, e.g., something like “Top 10% performer on interviewing.io”. Presumably, these certifications would signal to recruiters that this person is a good engineer and worth reaching out to and should carry more signal than where said person went to school or worked previously. I've always thought certifications were a terrible idea, and I’ve resisted building them. Now, we've finally dug into the data to see if my hatred of them holds water. TL;DR it does.Read more >Our business depends on having the best interviewers, so we built an interviewer rating system. And you can too.By Aline Lerner | Published: January 18, 2023; Last updated: May 2, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you’re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world’s best companies. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. To keep our engineer customers happy, we have to make sure that our interviewers deliver value to them by conducting realistic mock interviews and giving useful, actionable feedback afterwards. To keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they’re getting without us. Otherwise, it’s just not worth it for them. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In this post, we’ll explain exactly how we compute and use these metrics to get the best work out of our interviewers.Read more >How much have 2022 layoffs affected engineers vs. other departments? We dug into the data to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: October 13, 2022; Last updated: December 7, 2024Over the past few months, I’ve seen a number of fear-mongering pieces in the press about how the recession is driving tech layoffs and how tech employees (and engineers specifically) are losing their leverage as a result. The problem is that “tech” can mean anyone working at a tech company. You’re an engineer? Of course, you’re tech. You do ops? Great, you’re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn’t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It’s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that “tech” refers to engineers specifically. I don’t like imprecision, and I really don’t like fear-mongering. So, we at interviewing.io dug into the data to see if engineers do indeed have a reason to fear.Read more >The definitive list of companies who are hiring engineers right nowBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 20, 2022; Last updated: June 19, 2024interviewing.io is both a mock interview platform and an eng hiring marketplace (engineers use us for technical interview practice, and top performers get fast-tracked at companies), so we have some unique insights into how recent hiring freezes have affected engineers’ behavior. We also have unique insight into which companies are actually hiring. As such, in the spirit of being useful during a hard and uncertain time, we thought it’d be interesting to survey our users to see what’s actually going on in the market. TL;DR There are lots of engineers actively looking. There are also lots of companies who are actively hiring. Read the actual post to see the full list of 447 U.S. companies who are hiring software engineers right now.Read more >Does communication matter in technical interviewing? We looked at 100K interviews to find out. By Dima Korolev | Published: May 18, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023The interviewing.io platform has hosted and collected feedback from over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity. But how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that talk is cheap. Read on to find out how and why.Read more >We analyzed 100K technical interviews to see where the best performers work. Here are the results.By Aline Lerner | Published: March 31, 2022; Last updated: March 28, 2024At interviewing.io, we’ve hosted over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. As it happens, we know where our users currently work – they tell us that when they sign up. Given that we have this data AND given that we know how well people do in their interviews, we thought it would be interesting to see which companies’ engineers are especially good at technical interviews. Our resulting top ten lists are in this post!Read more >The Eng Hiring Bar: What the hell is it?By Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 31, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023Recursive Cactus has been working as a full-stack engineer at a well-known tech company for the past 5 years, but he’s now considering a career move. Over the past 6 months, Recursive Cactus (that’s his anonymous handle on interviewing.io) has been preparing himself to succeed in future interviews, dedicating as much as 20-30 hours/week plowing through LeetCode exercises, digesting algorithms textbooks, and of course, practicing interviews on our platform to benchmark his progress. But this dedication to interview prep has been taking an emotional toll on him, ...Read more >No engineer has ever sued a company because of constructive post-interview feedback. So why don’t employers do it?By Aline Lerner | Published: February 6, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023One of the things that sucks most about technical interviews is that they’re a black box—candidates (usually) get told whether they made it to the next round, but they’re rarely told why they got the outcome that they did. Lack of feedback, or feedback that doesn’t come right away, isn’t just frustrating to candidates. It’s bad for business. We did a whole study on this. It turns out that candidates chronically underrate and overrate their technical interview performance, like so: Where this finding starts to get actionable is that there’s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they’d want to work with you. In other words, …Read more >We ran the numbers, and there really is a pipeline problem in eng hiring.By Aline Lerner | Published: December 3, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you say the words “there’s a pipeline problem” to explain why we’ve failed to make meaningful progress toward gender parity in software engineering, you probably won’t make many friends (or many hires). The pipeline problem argument goes something like this: “There aren’t enough qualified women out there, so it’s not our fault if we don’t hire them.” Many people don’t like this reductive line of thinking because it ignores the growing body of research that points to unwelcoming environments that drive underrepresented talent out of tech: STEM in early education being unfriendly to children from underrepresented backgrounds, lack of a level playing field and unequal access to quality STEM education (see this study on …Read more >You probably don’t factor in engineering time when calculating cost per hire. Here’s why you really should.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 24, 2019; Last updated: September 18, 2023Whether you’re a recruiter yourself or an engineer who’s involved in hiring, you’ve probably heard of the following two recruiting-related metrics: time to hire and cost per hire. Indeed, these are THE two metrics that any self-respecting recruiting team will track. Time to hire is important because it lets you plan — if a given role has historically taken 3 months to fill, you’re going to act differently when you need to fill it again than if it takes 2 weeks. And, traditionally, cost per hire has been a planning tool as well — if you’re setting recruiting budgets for next year and have a headcount in mind, seeing what recruiting spent last year is …Read more >Can fake names create bias? An exploration into interviewing.io’s pseudonym generatorBy Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 7, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023Hello everyone, my name is Atomic Artichoke, and I’m the newest employee of the interviewing.io team, having joined a couple months ago as a Data Scientist. Atomic Artichoke isn’t my real name, of course. That’s the pseudonym the interviewing.io platform gave me, right before I took my final interview with the company. If you’ve never used interviewing.io before (and hey, if you haven’t already, why not sign up now?), it’s a platform where you can practice technical interviewing anonymously with experienced engineers (and do real job interviews anonymously too). When it’s time to interview, you and your partner meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard (check out recordings of …Read more >There is a real connection between technical interview performance and salary. Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 26, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023At the end of the day, money is a huge driver for the decisions we make about what jobs to go after. In the past, we’ve written about how to negotiate your salary, and there are a lot of labor statistics and reports out there looking at salaries in the tech industry as a whole. But as with many things in eng hiring, there’s very little concrete data on whether technical interview performance plays a role in compensation offers. So we set out to gather the data and asked our users who had gone on to successfully get jobs after using our platform to share their salary info. With our unique dataset of real coding …Read more >Impostor syndrome strikes men just as hard as women... and other findings from thousands of technical interviewsBy Aline Lerner | Published: October 30, 2018; Last updated: May 2, 2023The modern technical interview is a rite of passage for software engineers and (hopefully!) the precursor to a great job. But it’s also a huge source of stress and endless questions for new candidates. Just searching “how do I prepare for a technical interview” turns up millions of Medium posts, coding bootcamp blogs, Quora discussions, and entire books. Despite all this conversation, people struggle to know how they’re even doing in interviews. In a previous post, we found that a surprisingly large number of interviewing.io’s users consistently underestimate their performance, making them more likely to drop out of the process and ultimately harder to hire. Now, and with considerably more data (over 10k interviews led …Read more >We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered. It didn't.By Samantha Jordan | Published: February 13, 2018; Last updated: October 1, 2023interviewing.io is a platform where engineers practice technical interviewing anonymously. If things go well, they can unlock the ability to participate in real, still anonymous, interviews with top companies like Twitch, Lyft and more. Earlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students, with the intent of helping level the playing field right at the start of people’s careers. The sad truth is that with the state of college recruiting today, if you don’t attend one of very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim. It’s not fair, and it sucks, but university recruiting is still dominated by career fairs. Companies pragmatically choose to visit the same …Read more >What do the best interviewers have in common? We looked at thousands of real interviews to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 29, 2017; Last updated: July 14, 2023At interviewing.io, we’ve analyzed and written at some depth about what makes for a good interview from the perspective of an interviewee. However, despite the inherent power imbalance, interviewing is a two-way street. I wrote a while ago about how, in this market, recruiting isn’t about vetting as much as it is about selling, and not engaging candidates in the course of talking to them for an hour is a woefully missed opportunity. But, just like solving interview questions is a learned skill that takes time and practice, so, too, is the other side of the table. Being a good interviewer takes time and effort and a fundamental willingness to get out of autopilot and …Read more >We analyzed thousands of technical interviews on everything from language to code style.

Maybe you’re a college student or fresh grad who is going through the interviewing process for the first time. Maybe you’re an experienced software engineer who hasn’t even thought about interviews for a few years. Either way, the first step in the interviewing process ...Read more >LinkedIn endorsements are dumb. Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 27, 2017; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you’re an engineer who’s been endorsed on LinkedIn for any number of languages/frameworks/skills, you’ve probably noticed that something isn’t quite right. Maybe they’re frameworks you’ve never touched or languages you haven’t used since freshman year of college. No matter the specifics, you’re probably at least a bit wary of the value of the LinkedIn endorsements feature. The internets, too, don’t disappoint in enumerating some absurd potential endorsements or in bemoaning the lack of relevance of said endorsements, even when they’re given in earnest. Having a gut feeling for this is one thing, but we were curious about whether we could actually come up with some numbers that showed how useless endorsements can be, and …Read more >Lessons from 3,000 technical interviews… or how what you do after graduation matters way more than where you went to schoolBy Aline Lerner | Published: December 28, 2016; Last updated: May 2, 2023The first blog post I published that got any real attention was called “Lessons from a year’s worth of hiring data“. It was my attempt to understand what attributes of someone’s resume actually mattered for getting a software engineering job. Surprisingly, as it turned out, where someone went to school didn’t matter at all, and by far and away, the strongest signal came from the number of typos and grammatical errors on their resume. Since then, I’ve discovered (and written about) how useless resumes are, but ever since writing that first post, I’ve been itching to do something similar with interviewing.io’s data. For context, interviewing.io is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously …Read more >After a lot more data, technical interview performance really is kind of arbitrary.By Aline Lerner | Published: October 13, 2016; Last updated: March 28, 2024interviewing.io is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously, and if things go well, get jobs at top companies in the process. We started it because resumes suck and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle. In February of 2016, we published a post about how people’s technical interview performance, from interview to interview, seemed quite volatile. At the time, we just had a few hundred interviews to draw on, so as you can imagine, we were quite eager to rerun the numbers with the advent of more data. After drawing on over a thousand interviews, the numbers hold up. In …Read more >People are still bad at gauging their own interview performance.

In the past few months, we’ve amassed over 600 technical interviews along with their associated data and metadata. Interview questions tend to fall into the category of what you’d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role at a top company, and interviewers typically come from a mix of larger companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as engineering-focused startups like Asana, Mattermark, KeepSafe, and more.

At interviewing.io, my team and I have been trying to make hiring meritocratic for the last decade. I’ll also be the first to admit that DEI is ideologically flawed because of its emphasis on race and gender-based outcomes and its insistence on equality of those outcomes. In the last decade, we've seen a lot of bad stuff done in the name of DEI, firsthand. I'll talk about those in this post. But all the recent pro-meritocracy, anti-DEI rhetoric is bad. Yelling “Meritocracy!” as if it’s a fait accompli is just as harmful as the worst parts of DEI. I’d even go so far to say that the DEI movement has done more for meritocracy than the loud pro-meritocracy movement is doing right now. I’m delighted that “meritocracy” is no longer a dirty word. But, just saying it isn’t enough. We have to change our hiring practices. We need to stop using meritocracy as a shield to preserve the status quo. In this post, I talk about the flaws of DEI, the false promise of meritocracy, and what to do to actually make hiring meritocratic and fair.Read more >Refuting Bloomberg's analysis: ChatGPT isn't racist. But it is bad at recruiting.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 11, 2024; Last updated: April 17, 2024Bloomberg recently published an article saying ChatGPT has racial bias when evaluating resumes. We re-ran their numbers and saw that they didn't do any statistical significance testing. In other words, there's no evidence of racial bias, at least not in this data set. However, ChatGPT has another kind of bias -- it drastically overestimates the value of top companies and top schools and does non-traditional candidates a disservice as a result.Read more >The 3 things that diversity hiring initiatives get wrongBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 18, 2021; Last updated: June 19, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade. Five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies. We’ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs. For the last year or so, we’ve also been running a Fellowship program specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds. That’s all to say that even though I have developed some strong opinions about “diversity hiring” initiatives, my opinions are based not on anecdotes but on cold, hard data. And the data points …Read more >The technical interview practice gap, and how it keeps underrepresented groups out of software engineeringBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 9, 2021; Last updated: May 24, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade, and five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies.

But the problem is bigger than resumes. We’ve come to learn that interview practice matters just as much. The resume gets you in the door, and your interview performance is what gets you the offer. But, even though technical interviews are hard and scary for everyone — many of our users are senior engineers from FAANG who are terrified of getting back out there and code up the kinds of problems they don’t usually see at work while someone breathes down their neck — interview prep isn’t equitably distributed. This inequity never really …Read more >We ran the numbers, and there really is a pipeline problem in eng hiring.By Aline Lerner | Published: December 3, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you say the words “there’s a pipeline problem” to explain why we’ve failed to make meaningful progress toward gender parity in software engineering, you probably won’t make many friends (or many hires). The pipeline problem argument goes something like this: “There aren’t enough qualified women out there, so it’s not our fault if we don’t hire them.” Many people don’t like this reductive line of thinking because it ignores the growing body of research that points to unwelcoming environments that drive underrepresented talent out of tech: STEM in early education being unfriendly to children from underrepresented backgrounds, lack of a level playing field and unequal access to quality STEM education (see this study on …Read more >Can fake names create bias? An exploration into interviewing.io’s pseudonym generatorBy Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 7, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023Hello everyone, my name is Atomic Artichoke, and I’m the newest employee of the interviewing.io team, having joined a couple months ago as a Data Scientist. Atomic Artichoke isn’t my real name, of course. That’s the pseudonym the interviewing.io platform gave me, right before I took my final interview with the company. If you’ve never used interviewing.io before (and hey, if you haven’t already, why not sign up now?), it’s a platform where you can practice technical interviewing anonymously with experienced engineers (and do real job interviews anonymously too). When it’s time to interview, you and your partner meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard (check out recordings of …Read more >We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered. It didn't.By Samantha Jordan | Published: February 13, 2018; Last updated: October 1, 2023interviewing.io is a platform where engineers practice technical interviewing anonymously. If things go well, they can unlock the ability to participate in real, still anonymous, interviews with top companies like Twitch, Lyft and more. Earlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students, with the intent of helping level the playing field right at the start of people’s careers. The sad truth is that with the state of college recruiting today, if you don’t attend one of very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim. It’s not fair, and it sucks, but university recruiting is still dominated by career fairs. Companies pragmatically choose to visit the same …Read more >If you care about diversity, don't just hire from the same five schoolsBy Meena Boppana | Published: October 24, 2017; Last updated: June 20, 2023EDIT: Our university hiring platform is now on Product Hunt! If you’re a software engineer, you probably believe that, despite some glitches here and there, folks who have the technical chops can get hired as software engineers. We regularly hear stories about college dropouts, who, through hard work and sheer determination, bootstrapped themselves into millionaires. These stories appeal to our sense of wonder and our desire for fairness in the world, but the reality is very different. For many students looking for their first job, the odds of breaking into a top company are slim because they will likely never even have the chance to show their skills in an interview. For these students ...Read more >You can’t fix diversity in tech without fixing the technical interview.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 22, 2016; Last updated: July 15, 2023In the last few months, several large players, including Google and Facebook, have released their latest and ultimately disappointing diversity numbers. Even with increased effort and resources poured into diversity hiring programs, Facebook’s headcount for women and people of color hasn’t really increased in the past 3 years. Google’s numbers have looked remarkably similar, and both players have yet to make significant impact in the space, despite a number of initiatives spanning everything from a points system rewarding recruiters for bringing in candidates from diverse backgrounds, to increased funding for tech education, to efforts to hire more candidates from diverse backgrounds in key leadership positions. Why have gains in diversity hiring been so lackluster across …Read more >We built voice modulation to mask gender in technical interviews.

Here's the data.By Mike Mroczka | Published: September 12, 2024; Last updated: September 13, 2024Have you ever wondered if you should spend more time on LeetCode, participate in those contests, or focus on solving harder problems? A popular Reddit post suggests you need 700+ questions and a LeetCode rating between 1800-2000 to pass FAANG interviews. Is this really what the data supports? To answer these questions and more, we looked at our users' LeetCode ranks and ratings and tied them back to interview performance on our platform and whether those users worked at FAANG. In this post, we’ll share what we’ve learned.Read more >The other half, or why interviewers aren't always great and how to make them betterBy Jos Visser | Published: June 11, 2024It is high time we start talking about interviewing. I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about the other half? What about the interviewer? In the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. This stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the interviewer. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews. Maybe they have even done a few interviews! Consequently, there is a lot of bad interviewing being done. That needs to change.Read more >My manager is not promoting me. What should I do? Advice from an eng manager at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.By Swift Kraken | Published: March 28, 2024I’ve been an engineering manager at Amazon, Meta and Microsoft.

That’ll be $46,282.By Elliot Plant | Published: February 14, 2024Software engineering jobs come with a lot of perks. But that doesn’t mean our jobs are perfect. Work requires us to commute, reduces the time we can spend with family, increases our stress levels, and forces us to deal with teammates we don't gel with. And sometimes we work for companies with questionable morals and use technologies we don’t enjoy.  For some of us, it’s worth trading cash for a job that fits into our lives better. But how much cash? To figure this out, we surveyed our users about times they took jobs with lower compensation, why they did it, and how much money they left on the table. We have the numbers!Read more >How hard is it to cheat in technical interviews with ChatGPT? We ran an experiment.By Mike Mroczka | Published: January 31, 2024; Last updated: May 6, 2024Does ChatGPT make it easy to cheat in technical interviews? To find out, we ran an experiment where we instructed interviewees on our platform to use ChatGPT in their interviews, unbeknownst to their interviewers. The results were surprising, but as a preview, know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately.Read more >How software engineering behavioral interviews are evaluated at Meta (from an ex-Meta manager)By Lior Neu-ner | Published: February 14, 2023; Last updated: April 28, 2025Hi, I’m Lior. I spent close to five years at Meta as a software engineer and engineering manager. During my time there I conducted more than 150 behavioral interviews. In this post, I’ll be sharing what Meta looks for in a behavioral interview, and how we evaluated candidates.Read more >Does communication matter in technical interviewing? We looked at 100K interviews to find out. By Dima Korolev | Published: May 18, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023The interviewing.io platform has hosted and collected feedback from over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity. But how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that talk is cheap. Read on to find out how and why.Read more >Hamtips, or why I still run the Technical Phone Screen as the Hiring ManagerBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: October 6, 2021; Last updated: May 2, 2023“Hamtips” stands for “Hiring Manager Technical Phone Screen.” This combines two calls: the Technical Phone Screen (TPS), which is a coding exercise that usually happens before the onsite, and the HMS call, which is a call with the Hiring Manager. By combining these two steps you shorten the intro-to-offer by ~1 week and reduce candidate dropoff by 5-10%. It’s also a lot less work for recruiters playing scheduling battleship. Finally, Hiring Managers will, on average, be better at selling working at the company – it’s kind of their job.Read more >Technical phone screen superforecastersBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: November 25, 2020; Last updated: July 14, 2023“The new VP wants us to double engineering’s headcount in the next six months. If we have a chance in hell to hit the hiring target, you seriously need to reconsider how fussy you’ve become.” It’s never good to have a recruiter ask engineers to lower their hiring bar, but he had a point. It can take upwards of 100 engineering hours to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire. Visnu and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the onsite pass rate went back up, and interviewing burnout receded. We didn’t lower the hiring bar, though. There was a better way.Read more >I’ve conducted over 600 technical interviews on interviewing.io. Here are 5 common problem areas I’ve seen.By Ian Douglas | Published: October 15, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I recently conducted my 600th interview on interviewing.io (IIO). I’d like to share lessons learned, why I approach interviews the way that I do, and shed some light on common problem areas I see happen in technical interviews. Every interviewer on the platform is different, and so your results may vary. We have some excellent folks helping out on the platform, and have a wonderful community working to better ourselves.Read more >6 red flags I saw while doing 60+ technical interviews in 30 daysBy Uduak Obong-Eren | Published: September 15, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023What is the one thing you would look out for if you had to join a company? Sometime between January and February 2020, I wanted to change jobs and was looking to join a new company. This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews – 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. Doing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

We don't do it, despite a lot of our users asking for this feature. The reason I've refused to build them is because, simply put, resume writing is snake oil. Why? Because recruiters aren't reading resumes. If you don't have top brands, better wording won't help.

At interviewing.io, my team and I have been trying to make hiring meritocratic for the last decade. I’ll also be the first to admit that DEI is ideologically flawed because of its emphasis on race and gender-based outcomes and its insistence on equality of those outcomes. In the last decade, we've seen a lot of bad stuff done in the name of DEI, firsthand. I'll talk about those in this post. But all the recent pro-meritocracy, anti-DEI rhetoric is bad. Yelling “Meritocracy!” as if it’s a fait accompli is just as harmful as the worst parts of DEI. I’d even go so far to say that the DEI movement has done more for meritocracy than the loud pro-meritocracy movement is doing right now. I’m delighted that “meritocracy” is no longer a dirty word. But, just saying it isn’t enough. We have to change our hiring practices. We need to stop using meritocracy as a shield to preserve the status quo. In this post, I talk about the flaws of DEI, the false promise of meritocracy, and what to do to actually make hiring meritocratic and fair.Read more >Are recruiters better than a coin flip at judging resumes? Here's the data.By Aline Lerner and Peter Bergman | Published: May 1, 2024; Last updated: May 20, 2024In partnership with the team at Learning Collider, we ran a study to see how good recruiters were at judging resumes. We asked technical recruiters to review and make judgments about engineers’ resumes, just as they would in their current roles. They answered two questions per resume: Would you interview this candidate? What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview? We ended up with nearly 2,200 evaluations of over 1,000 resumes. We then compared those judgments to how those engineers performed in interviews on our platform. Here's what we learned.Read more >How hard is it to cheat in technical interviews with ChatGPT? We ran an experiment.By Mike Mroczka | Published: January 31, 2024; Last updated: May 6, 2024Does ChatGPT make it easy to cheat in technical interviews? To find out, we ran an experiment where we instructed interviewees on our platform to use ChatGPT in their interviews, unbeknownst to their interviewers. The results were surprising, but as a preview, know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately.Read more >The 3 things that diversity hiring initiatives get wrongBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 18, 2021; Last updated: June 19, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade. Five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies. We’ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs. For the last year or so, we’ve also been running a Fellowship program specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds. That’s all to say that even though I have developed some strong opinions about “diversity hiring” initiatives, my opinions are based not on anecdotes but on cold, hard data. And the data points …Read more >The technical interview practice gap, and how it keeps underrepresented groups out of software engineeringBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 9, 2021; Last updated: May 24, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade, and five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies.

Anonymous technical interview practice for all!By Aline Lerner | Published: June 4, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io 5 years ago. After working as both an engineer and a recruiter, my frustration with how inefficient and unfair hiring had reached a boiling point. What made me especially angry was that despite mounting evidence that resumes are poor predictors of aptitude, employers were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously. In my mind, any great engineer, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to get their foot in the door wherever they choose. So, we set out to build a better system. On interviewing.io, software engineers can book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Facebook, Google, and others, and if …Read more >The Eng Hiring Bar: What the hell is it?By Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 31, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023Recursive Cactus has been working as a full-stack engineer at a well-known tech company for the past 5 years, but he’s now considering a career move. Over the past 6 months, Recursive Cactus (that’s his anonymous handle on interviewing.io) has been preparing himself to succeed in future interviews, dedicating as much as 20-30 hours/week plowing through LeetCode exercises, digesting algorithms textbooks, and of course, practicing interviews on our platform to benchmark his progress. But this dedication to interview prep has been taking an emotional toll on him, ...Read more >No engineer has ever sued a company because of constructive post-interview feedback. So why don’t employers do it?By Aline Lerner | Published: February 6, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023One of the things that sucks most about technical interviews is that they’re a black box—candidates (usually) get told whether they made it to the next round, but they’re rarely told why they got the outcome that they did. Lack of feedback, or feedback that doesn’t come right away, isn’t just frustrating to candidates. It’s bad for business. We did a whole study on this. It turns out that candidates chronically underrate and overrate their technical interview performance, like so: Where this finding starts to get actionable is that there’s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they’d want to work with you. In other words, …Read more >We ran the numbers, and there really is a pipeline problem in eng hiring.By Aline Lerner | Published: December 3, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you say the words “there’s a pipeline problem” to explain why we’ve failed to make meaningful progress toward gender parity in software engineering, you probably won’t make many friends (or many hires). The pipeline problem argument goes something like this: “There aren’t enough qualified women out there, so it’s not our fault if we don’t hire them.” Many people don’t like this reductive line of thinking because it ignores the growing body of research that points to unwelcoming environments that drive underrepresented talent out of tech: STEM in early education being unfriendly to children from underrepresented backgrounds, lack of a level playing field and unequal access to quality STEM education (see this study on …Read more >We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered. It didn't.By Samantha Jordan | Published: February 13, 2018; Last updated: October 1, 2023interviewing.io is a platform where engineers practice technical interviewing anonymously. If things go well, they can unlock the ability to participate in real, still anonymous, interviews with top companies like Twitch, Lyft and more. Earlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students, with the intent of helping level the playing field right at the start of people’s careers. The sad truth is that with the state of college recruiting today, if you don’t attend one of very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim. It’s not fair, and it sucks, but university recruiting is still dominated by career fairs. Companies pragmatically choose to visit the same …Read more >If you care about diversity, don't just hire from the same five schoolsBy Meena Boppana | Published: October 24, 2017; Last updated: June 20, 2023EDIT: Our university hiring platform is now on Product Hunt! If you’re a software engineer, you probably believe that, despite some glitches here and there, folks who have the technical chops can get hired as software engineers. We regularly hear stories about college dropouts, who, through hard work and sheer determination, bootstrapped themselves into millionaires. These stories appeal to our sense of wonder and our desire for fairness in the world, but the reality is very different. For many students looking for their first job, the odds of breaking into a top company are slim because they will likely never even have the chance to show their skills in an interview. For these students ...Read more >LinkedIn endorsements are dumb. Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 27, 2017; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you’re an engineer who’s been endorsed on LinkedIn for any number of languages/frameworks/skills, you’ve probably noticed that something isn’t quite right. Maybe they’re frameworks you’ve never touched or languages you haven’t used since freshman year of college. No matter the specifics, you’re probably at least a bit wary of the value of the LinkedIn endorsements feature. The internets, too, don’t disappoint in enumerating some absurd potential endorsements or in bemoaning the lack of relevance of said endorsements, even when they’re given in earnest. Having a gut feeling for this is one thing, but we were curious about whether we could actually come up with some numbers that showed how useless endorsements can be, and …Read more >You can’t fix diversity in tech without fixing the technical interview.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 22, 2016; Last updated: July 15, 2023In the last few months, several large players, including Google and Facebook, have released their latest and ultimately disappointing diversity numbers. Even with increased effort and resources poured into diversity hiring programs, Facebook’s headcount for women and people of color hasn’t really increased in the past 3 years. Google’s numbers have looked remarkably similar, and both players have yet to make significant impact in the space, despite a number of initiatives spanning everything from a points system rewarding recruiters for bringing in candidates from diverse backgrounds, to increased funding for tech education, to efforts to hire more candidates from diverse backgrounds in key leadership positions. Why have gains in diversity hiring been so lackluster across …Read more >Resumes suck. Here's the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 11, 2014; Last updated: April 10, 2024About a year ago, after looking at the resumes of engineers we had interviewed at TrialPay in 2012, I learned that the strongest signal for whether someone would get an offer was the number of typos and grammatical errors on their resume. On the other hand, where people went to school, their GPA, and highest degree earned didn’t matter at all. These results were pretty unexpected, ran counter to how resumes were normally filtered, and left me scratching my head ...Read more >Lessons from a year’s worth of hiring dataBy Aline Lerner | Published: June 22, 2013; Last updated: May 2, 2023I ran technical recruiting at TrialPay for a year before going off to start my own agency.

It’s a classic, and the main point is that good design should make everything painfully obvious to users without demanding anything of them. Resumes are just the same. Your resume shouldn’t make recruiters think. It should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less. We've said before that spending a lot of time on your resume is a fool's errand, but if you’re going to do something to it, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Here's exactly what to do.Read more >Why resume writing is snake oilBy Aline Lerner | Published: April 2, 2025A lot of other platforms offer resume reviews or help with writing resumes for $$. We don't do it, despite a lot of our users asking for this feature. The reason I've refused to build them is because, simply put, resume writing is snake oil. Why? Because recruiters aren't reading resumes. If you don't have top brands, better wording won't help. If you do have top brands, the wording doesn't matter.Read more >It's OK to postpone your interviews if you're not readyBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 25, 2025; Last updated: April 28, 2025At interviewing.io, we’ve seen hundreds of thousands of engineers go through job searches, and the biggest mistakes we see people make are all variations on the same theme: not postponing their interview when they aren’t ready. In most situations, there is no downside to postponing. In this post, we'll tell you what to do and say.Read more >How well do LeetCode ratings predict interview performance? Here's the data.By Mike Mroczka | Published: September 12, 2024; Last updated: September 13, 2024Have you ever wondered if you should spend more time on LeetCode, participate in those contests, or focus on solving harder problems? A popular Reddit post suggests you need 700+ questions and a LeetCode rating between 1800-2000 to pass FAANG interviews. Is this really what the data supports? To answer these questions and more, we looked at our users' LeetCode ranks and ratings and tied them back to interview performance on our platform and whether those users worked at FAANG. In this post, we’ll share what we’ve learned.Read more >How to get in the door at top companies: cold outreach to hiring managers. Part 2 of 2.By Aline Lerner | Published: July 31, 2024; Last updated: November 3, 2024In part 1 of this post, we analyzed different ways to get into companies along two axes: effectiveness and how much control you actually have. The channel that maximizes both effectiveness and control is cold outreach to hiring managers (not recruiters!). And yet, most people do this type of outreach incorrectly. In this post, we'll tell you exactly what to do and what to say to reach out to hiring managers at top companies and get responses.Read more >How to get in the door at top companies: a data-driven, practical guide for software engineers. Part 1.By Aline Lerner | Published: July 24, 2024; Last updated: October 28, 2024interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform — we help engineers prepare for technical interviews. In this market, many of our users are struggling with getting in the door at companies, so we ran a survey to see what’s worked well and what hasn’t, in today’s difficult climate. Not surprisingly, warm referrals are the best way in. On the other hand, agency recruiters are clearly the worst. But not all channels are created equal. Some, like recruiters contacting you, you have minimal control over, and whether you get contacted is largely a function of whether you have top brands on your resume or belong to an underrepresented group. With others, like reaching out to hiring managers, you are fully in control of your destiny. Here's how to make the most of a difficult landscape.Read more >I’ve never written code, but I just passed a Google system design interview.By Kevin Landucci | Published: August 10, 2023; Last updated: August 31, 2023My name is Kevin. I am not and have never been a software engineer. I have never written or tested a single line of code, and I have never even worked as a PM. Despite that, I was able to pass a Google system design interview. I had just finished working on a system design interview guide and learned a LOT from doing that, but I also learned a few tricks along the way. If these tricks helped me pass, then imagine what you’ll be able to do with them.Read more >How software engineering behavioral interviews are evaluated at Meta (from an ex-Meta manager)By Lior Neu-ner | Published: February 14, 2023; Last updated: April 28, 2025Hi, I’m Lior.

We looked at 100K interviews to find out. By Dima Korolev | Published: May 18, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023The interviewing.io platform has hosted and collected feedback from over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity. But how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that talk is cheap. Read on to find out how and why.Read more >We analyzed 100K technical interviews to see where the best performers work. Here are the results.By Aline Lerner | Published: March 31, 2022; Last updated: March 28, 2024At interviewing.io, we’ve hosted over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. As it happens, we know where our users currently work – they tell us that when they sign up. Given that we have this data AND given that we know how well people do in their interviews, we thought it would be interesting to see which companies’ engineers are especially good at technical interviews. Our resulting top ten lists are in this post!Read more >How do I know if I’m ready to interview at FAANG?By Atomic Artichoke | Published: December 3, 2020; Last updated: June 19, 2024Recently, someone asked us how you know you’re ready to succeed in a Facebook/Amazon/Apple/Netflix/Google (FAANG) interview. It’s an interesting question, and one I’m sure many of you job seekers out there are wondering. Internally, we have our own beliefs, but we wanted to see if we could answer this question more objectively. So we set off on a journey to acquire data to try answering it.Read more >I’ve conducted over 600 technical interviews on interviewing.io.

Sometime between January and February 2020, I wanted to change jobs and was looking to join a new company. This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews – 60+ technical interviews in 30 days.

We learned a lot—mostly about candidates' poor experiences and negative feelings toward take-homes. They take a lot of time. They don’t respect candidates’ time. Candidates often get no feedback. And candidates are almost never compensated. Really, it's all about value asymmetry. The good news? Turns out there are some pretty simple things companies can do to vastly improve their take-home assignmentsRead more >The other half, or why interviewers aren't always great and how to make them betterBy Jos Visser | Published: June 11, 2024It is high time we start talking about interviewing. I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about the other half? What about the interviewer? In the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. This stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the interviewer. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews. Maybe they have even done a few interviews! Consequently, there is a lot of bad interviewing being done. That needs to change.Read more >Why AI can’t do hiringBy Aline Lerner | Published: May 16, 2023; Last updated: March 7, 2024The recent exciting and somewhat horrifying inflection point in AI capability tipped me into writing this blog post. I simply don't believe that AI can do hiring. My argument isn't about bias (though bias is a real problem) or that it's technologically impossible. It's just that the training data simply isn't available. Most people believe that if you can somehow combine what's available on LinkedIn, GitHub, and the social graph (who follows whom on Twitter etc.), you'll be able to find the good engineers who are actively looking and also figure out what they want. This is wrong. None of those 3 sources are actually useful. At the end of the day, you can’t use AI for hiring if you don’t have the data. And if you have the data, then you don’t strictly need AI.Read more >We have the best technical interviewers on the market. Here's how we do it.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 28, 2023; Last updated: August 27, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers in a way that no single employer does – if we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In a recent post, we shared how, over time, we came up with two metrics that, together, tell a complete and compelling story about interviewer quality: the candidate experience metric and the calibration metric. In this post, we’ll talk about how to apply our learnings about interviewer quality to your own process. We’ve made a bunch of mistakes so you don’t have to! It boils down to choosing the right people, tracking those 2 metrics diligently, rewarding good behavior, and committing to providing feedback to your candidates.Read more >Why giving feedback (whether it’s good or bad) will help you hireBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 13, 2023; Last updated: May 2, 2023Giving feedback will not only make candidates you want today more likely to join your team, but it’s also crucial to hiring the candidates you might want down the road. Technical interview outcomes are erratic, and according to our data, only about 25% of candidates perform consistently from interview to interview.Read more >Our business depends on having the best interviewers, so we built an interviewer rating system. And you can too.By Aline Lerner | Published: January 18, 2023; Last updated: May 2, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you’re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world’s best companies. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. To keep our engineer customers happy, we have to make sure that our interviewers deliver value to them by conducting realistic mock interviews and giving useful, actionable feedback afterwards. To keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they’re getting without us. Otherwise, it’s just not worth it for them. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In this post, we’ll explain exactly how we compute and use these metrics to get the best work out of our interviewers.Read more >Hamtips, or why I still run the Technical Phone Screen as the Hiring ManagerBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: October 6, 2021; Last updated: May 2, 2023“Hamtips” stands for “Hiring Manager Technical Phone Screen.” This combines two calls: the Technical Phone Screen (TPS), which is a coding exercise that usually happens before the onsite, and the HMS call, which is a call with the Hiring Manager. By combining these two steps you shorten the intro-to-offer by ~1 week and reduce candidate dropoff by 5-10%. It’s also a lot less work for recruiters playing scheduling battleship. Finally, Hiring Managers will, on average, be better at selling working at the company – it’s kind of their job.Read more >How to write (actually) good job descriptionsBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 23, 2021; Last updated: May 2, 2023When you start writing a job description, the first question you should ask yourself is, Am I trying to attract the right people, or am I trying to keep the wrong people out? Then, once you answer it, write for that audience deliberately, because it’s really hard to write for both…Read more >The technical interview practice gap, and how it keeps underrepresented groups out of software engineeringBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 9, 2021; Last updated: May 24, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade, and five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies. We’ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs. Since last year, we’ve also been running a Fellowship program specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds. All that is to say that even though I have strong opinions about “diversity hiring” initiatives, I’ve acquired them the honest way, through laboratory experience.Read more >Technical phone screen superforecastersBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: November 25, 2020; Last updated: July 14, 2023“The new VP wants us to double engineering’s headcount in the next six months. If we have a chance in hell to hit the hiring target, you seriously need to reconsider how fussy you’ve become.” It’s never good to have a recruiter ask engineers to lower their hiring bar, but he had a point. It can take upwards of 100 engineering hours to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire. Visnu and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the onsite pass rate went back up, and interviewing burnout receded. We didn’t lower the hiring bar, though. There was a better way.Read more >No engineer has ever sued a company because of constructive post-interview feedback. So why don’t employers do it?By Aline Lerner | Published: February 6, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023One of the things that sucks most about technical interviews is that they’re a black box—candidates (usually) get told whether they made it to the next round, but they’re rarely told why they got the outcome that they did. Lack of feedback, or feedback that doesn’t come right away, isn’t just frustrating to candidates. It’s bad for business. We did a whole study on this. It turns out that candidates chronically underrate and overrate their technical interview performance, like so: Where this finding starts to get actionable is that there’s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they’d want to work with you. In other words, …Read more >3 exercises to craft the kind of employer brand that actually makes engineers want to work for youBy Aline Lerner | Published: May 14, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023If I’m honest, I’ve wanted to write something about employer brand for a long time. One of the things that really gets my goat is when companies build employer brand by over-indexing on banalities (“look we have a ping pong table!”, “look we’re a startup so you’ll have a huge impact”, etc.) instead of focusing on the narratives that make them special. Hiring engineers is really hard. It’s hard for tech giants, and it’s hard for small companies… but it’s especially hard for small companies people haven’t quite heard of, and they can use all the help they can get because talking about impact and ping pong tables just doesn’t cut it anymore. At interviewing.io, …Read more >You probably don’t factor in engineering time when calculating cost per hire. Here’s why you really should.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 24, 2019; Last updated: September 18, 2023Whether you’re a recruiter yourself or an engineer who’s involved in hiring, you’ve probably heard of the following two recruiting-related metrics: time to hire and cost per hire. Indeed, these are THE two metrics that any self-respecting recruiting team will track. Time to hire is important because it lets you plan — if a given role has historically taken 3 months to fill, you’re going to act differently when you need to fill it again than if it takes 2 weeks. And, traditionally, cost per hire has been a planning tool as well — if you’re setting recruiting budgets for next year and have a headcount in mind, seeing what recruiting spent last year is …Read more >What do the best interviewers have in common? We looked at thousands of real interviews to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 29, 2017; Last updated: July 14, 2023At interviewing.io, we’ve analyzed and written at some depth about what makes for a good interview from the perspective of an interviewee. However, despite the inherent power imbalance, interviewing is a two-way street. I wrote a while ago about how, in this market, recruiting isn’t about vetting as much as it is about selling, and not engaging candidates in the course of talking to them for an hour is a woefully missed opportunity. But, just like solving interview questions is a learned skill that takes time and practice, so, too, is the other side of the table. Being a good interviewer takes time and effort and a fundamental willingness to get out of autopilot and …Read more >People are still bad at gauging their own interview performance. Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: September 8, 2016; Last updated: May 2, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous technical interviewing platform. We started it because resumes suck and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle. In the past few months, we’ve amassed over 600 technical interviews along with their associated data and metadata. Interview questions tend to fall into the category of what you’d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role at a top company, and interviewers typically come from a mix of larger companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as engineering-focused startups like Asana, Mattermark, KeepSafe, and more. Over the course of the next few posts, we’ll be sharing some …Read more >A founder’s guide to making your first recruiting hireBy Aline Lerner | Published: April 26, 2016; Last updated: May 2, 2023Recently, a number of founder friends have asked me about how to approach their first recruiting hire, and I’ve found myself repeating the same stuff over and over again. Below are some of my most salient thoughts on the subject. Note that I’ll be talking a lot about engineering hiring because that’s what I know, but I expect a lot of this applies to other fields as well, especially ones where the demand for labor outstrips supply. Don’t get caught up by flashy employment history; hustle trumps brands At first glance, hiring someone who’s done recruiting for highly successful tech giants seems like a no-brainer. Google and Facebook are good at hiring great engineers, right? …Read more >Engineers can't gauge their own interview performance.

And, traditionally, cost per hire has been a planning tool as well — if you’re setting recruiting budgets for next year and have a headcount in mind, seeing what recruiting spent last year is …\",\"image\":{\"data\":{\"id\":190,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"fc5ff-screenshot-2019-04-22-14.42.10.webp\",\"alternativeText\":\"fc5ff-screenshot-2019-04-22-14.42.10.webp\",\"caption\":\"fc5ff-screenshot-2019-04-22-14.42.10.webp\",\"width\":629,\"height\":99,\"formats\":{\"small\":{\"ext\":\".webp\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/small\\_fc5ff\\_screenshot\\_2019\\_04\\_22\\_14\\_42\\_10\\_cdf4827348.webp\",\"hash\":\"small\\_fc5ff\\_screenshot\\_2019\\_04\\_22\\_14\\_42\\_10\\_cdf4827348\",\"mime\":\"image/webp\",\"name\":\"small\\_fc5ff-screenshot-2019-04-22-14.42.10.webp\",\"path\":null,\"size\":3.96,\"width\":500,\"height\":79},\"thumbnail\":{\"ext\":\".webp\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail\\_fc5ff\\_screenshot\\_2019\\_04\\_22\\_14\\_42\\_10\\_cdf4827348.webp\",\"hash\":\"thumbnail\\_fc5ff\\_screenshot\\_2019\\_04\\_22\\_14\\_42\\_10\\_cdf4827348\",\"mime\":\"image/webp\",\"name\":\"thumbnail\\_fc5ff-screenshot-2019-04-22-14.42.10.webp\",\"path\":null,\"size\":1.64,\"width\":245,\"height\":39}},\"hash\":\"fc5ff\\_screenshot\\_2019\\_04\\_22\\_14\\_42\\_10\\_cdf4827348\",\"ext\":\".webp\",\"mime\":\"image/webp\",\"size\":5.6,\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fc5ff\\_screenshot\\_2019\\_04\\_22\\_14\\_42\\_10\\_cdf4827348.webp\",\"previewUrl\":null,\"provider\":\"aws-s3\",\"provider\\_metadata\":null,\"createdAt\":\"2022-11-14T23:47:27.654Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2022-11-14T23:47:27.654Z\"}}},\"category\":{\"data\":\\[{\"id\":1,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Data deep dives\",\"slug\":\"data-deep-dives\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-09-27T16:59:29.755Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-05-04T00:41:57.214Z\"}},{\"id\":5,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"For employers/How to hire better\",\"slug\":\"for-employers-how-to-hire-better\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-12-12T19:28:37.748Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-05-04T00:42:11.494Z\"}}\\]},\"authors\":{\"data\":\\[{\"id\":1,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Aline Lerner\",\"email\":\"aline@interviewing.io\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-09-27T16:58:49.743Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2022-09-27T16:58:49.743Z\",\"description\":null,\"tag\\_line\":null}}\\]},\"blogPostSEO\":{\"id\":51,\"metaTitle\":null,\"metaDescription\":\"Whether you’re a recruiter or an engineer, you’ve probably heard of \\\\\"cost per hire\\\\\".

I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about the other half? What about the interviewer? In the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. This stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the interviewer. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews. Maybe they have even done a few interviews! Consequently, there is a lot of bad interviewing being done. That needs to change.Read more >Are recruiters better than a coin flip at judging resumes? Here's the data.By Aline Lerner and Peter Bergman | Published: May 1, 2024; Last updated: May 20, 2024In partnership with the team at Learning Collider, we ran a study to see how good recruiters were at judging resumes. We asked technical recruiters to review and make judgments about engineers’ resumes, just as they would in their current roles. They answered two questions per resume: Would you interview this candidate? What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview? We ended up with nearly 2,200 evaluations of over 1,000 resumes. We then compared those judgments to how those engineers performed in interviews on our platform. Here's what we learned.Read more >Refuting Bloomberg's analysis: ChatGPT isn't racist. But it is bad at recruiting.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 11, 2024; Last updated: April 17, 2024Bloomberg recently published an article saying ChatGPT has racial bias when evaluating resumes. We re-ran their numbers and saw that they didn't do any statistical significance testing. In other words, there's no evidence of racial bias, at least not in this data set. However, ChatGPT has another kind of bias -- it drastically overestimates the value of top companies and top schools and does non-traditional candidates a disservice as a result.Read more >My manager is not promoting me.

I'm really smart. I got a 4.9 GPA at MIT. By this time I had worked with a pretty wide range of different software languages, tools, frameworks, ideologies, etc. I had managed 30+ people and could also plan and build complex systems solo when needed. I felt very qualified for the positions I was applying for. On my first Big Tech Interview, I did terribly.Read more >The unwritten rules (till now) of negotiating with MetaBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 27, 2024; Last updated: February 25, 2025Recently, while helping our users negotiate, we've observed a string of aggressive, candidate-unfriendly hiring practices at Meta. We’ve seen the same practices with enough candidates, and across enough different titles and positions, that it’s become clear that they are not isolated incidents or a rogue recruiter’s doing but rather a consistent implementation of a deliberate strategy that comes from the top. If you’re negotiating with Meta, you need to know how they operate and understand the unwritten rules of the game. If you do not know the rules, you will fail — long before you even start negotiating.Read more >Want to work from home? That’ll be $46,282.By Elliot Plant | Published: February 14, 2024Software engineering jobs come with a lot of perks. But that doesn’t mean our jobs are perfect. Work requires us to commute, reduces the time we can spend with family, increases our stress levels, and forces us to deal with teammates we don't gel with. And sometimes we work for companies with questionable morals and use technologies we don’t enjoy.  For some of us, it’s worth trading cash for a job that fits into our lives better. But how much cash? To figure this out, we surveyed our users about times they took jobs with lower compensation, why they did it, and how much money they left on the table. We have the numbers!Read more >How hard is it to cheat in technical interviews with ChatGPT?

To find out, we ran an experiment where we instructed interviewees on our platform to use ChatGPT in their interviews, unbeknownst to their interviewers. The results were surprising, but as a preview, know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately.Read more >When is hiring coming back?

We’re good at it — our average user gets $50k more in cash, and we have a 94% success rate. Having done this a lot, we’ve seen our users make the same two mistakes, over and over, BEFORE they start working with us. These mistakes are costly and make it harder for us to do our jobs. Both involve how you talk to recruiters at the start of your job search, way before there’s an offer.

I simply don't believe that AI can do hiring. My argument isn't about bias (though bias is a real problem) or that it's technologically impossible. It's just that the training data simply isn't available. Most people believe that if you can somehow combine what's available on LinkedIn, GitHub, and the social graph (who follows whom on Twitter etc.), you'll be able to find the good engineers who are actively looking and also figure out what they want. This is wrong. None of those 3 sources are actually useful. At the end of the day, you can’t use AI for hiring if you don’t have the data. And if you have the data, then you don’t strictly need AI.Read more >Does posting Open To Work on LinkedIn help or hurt? A tale of two labor markets.By Aline Lerner and Maxim Massenkoff | Published: April 11, 2023; Last updated: May 29, 2023If you’re a software engineer who’s on the market, should you list yourself as OpenToWork? Does doing so carry a negative signal? And with the recent deluge of layoffs at tech companies, has the meaning of OpenToWork changed? TL;DR It used to be bad. Now, it's not. Moreover, it's clear to us that the people who were laid off in the 2nd half of 2022 and 2023 so far are great... and that, by and large, these layoffs were indeed NOT based on performance.Read more >Why you shouldn’t list certifications on LinkedInBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 14, 2023; Last updated: May 16, 2023People often suggest that interviewing.io should create a certification that our users can post on their LinkedIn profile, e.g., something like “Top 10% performer on interviewing.io”. Presumably, these certifications would signal to recruiters that this person is a good engineer and worth reaching out to and should carry more signal than where said person went to school or worked previously. I've always thought certifications were a terrible idea, and I’ve resisted building them. Now, we've finally dug into the data to see if my hatred of them holds water. TL;DR it does.Read more >We have the best technical interviewers on the market. Here's how we do it.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 28, 2023; Last updated: August 27, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers in a way that no single employer does – if we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In a recent post, we shared how, over time, we came up with two metrics that, together, tell a complete and compelling story about interviewer quality: the candidate experience metric and the calibration metric. In this post, we’ll talk about how to apply our learnings about interviewer quality to your own process. We’ve made a bunch of mistakes so you don’t have to! It boils down to choosing the right people, tracking those 2 metrics diligently, rewarding good behavior, and committing to providing feedback to your candidates.Read more >How software engineering behavioral interviews are evaluated at Meta (from an ex-Meta manager)By Lior Neu-ner | Published: February 14, 2023; Last updated: April 28, 2025Hi, I’m Lior.

Technical interview outcomes are erratic, and according to our data, only about 25% of candidates perform consistently from interview to interview.Read more >How many engineers have gotten laid off in 2022 and 2023 so far?By Aline Lerner | Published: January 27, 2023; Last updated: May 6, 2024I recently ran a Twitter poll asking my followers to estimate how many engineers had been laid off from US-based startups and tech companies in 2022 and 2023 so far. Most people overestimated the number by an order of magnitude. Here's what we did to get to the actual number.Read more >Our business depends on having the best interviewers, so we built an interviewer rating system. And you can too.By Aline Lerner | Published: January 18, 2023; Last updated: May 2, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you’re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world’s best companies. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. To keep our engineer customers happy, we have to make sure that our interviewers deliver value to them by conducting realistic mock interviews and giving useful, actionable feedback afterwards. To keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they’re getting without us. Otherwise, it’s just not worth it for them. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In this post, we’ll explain exactly how we compute and use these metrics to get the best work out of our interviewers.Read more >You now need to do 15% better in technical interviews than you did at the start of 2022 (and the bar will keep rising).By Aline Lerner | Published: December 1, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024interviewing.io is a technical mock interview platform and technical recruiting marketplace, so we have a ton of useful data around technical interviewing and hiring. One of the most useful pieces of data in the current climate is the ever-changing technical interview bar – throughout 2022, it’s gotten progressively harder to pass technical interviews, and it’s only going to keep getting harder. We crunched the numbers and came up with a running index that quantifies where the eng bar will be, as a function of open tech jobs. The bar is clearly going up.Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

We dug into the data to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: October 13, 2022; Last updated: December 7, 2024Over the past few months, I’ve seen a number of fear-mongering pieces in the press about how the recession is driving tech layoffs and how tech employees (and engineers specifically) are losing their leverage as a result. The problem is that “tech” can mean anyone working at a tech company. You’re an engineer? Of course, you’re tech. You do ops? Great, you’re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn’t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It’s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that “tech” refers to engineers specifically. I don’t like imprecision, and I really don’t like fear-mongering. So, we at interviewing.io dug into the data to see if engineers do indeed have a reason to fear.Read more >Why we’re pausing our Pay Later ProgramBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 29, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023We recently made the difficult decision to pause our Pay Later Program. In this post, we’ll talk about why we made that call and what we’ll be doing instead to ensure that engineers who can’t afford to pay for practice will still be able to get it.

As such, in the spirit of being useful during a hard and uncertain time, we thought it’d be interesting to survey our users to see what’s actually going on in the market. TL;DR There are lots of engineers actively looking. There are also lots of companies who are actively hiring. Read the actual post to see the full list of 447 U.S. companies who are hiring software engineers right now.Read more >Building interviewing.io's collaborative & replayable whiteboard, or making systems design interviews not suckBy Shehbaj Dhillon | Published: September 6, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023During the spring of 2022, I went from being a user of interviewing.io to being one of the engineers on the team. I discovered interviewing.io in 2021 while preparing for my internship interviews, little did I know that I would end up interviewing for interviewing.io via an interview conducted on interviewing.io to receive an internship opportunity at interviewing.io upon passing the said interview. Yes. During my 11 weeks, I solved an important business problem, quadrupled my problem-solving skills, and collaborated with the fantastic folks who built the product made for engineers, by engineers.Read more >What’s actually going on with Google and Facebook hiring freezes? We surveyed 1000 engineers to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: August 1, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024It looks like we’re entering a recession. One of the hardest things about it is the lack of reliable information about whether companies are still hiring and what hiring freezes even mean. Arguably the two most impactful eng hiring freezes were announced by Facebook (May 4, 2022) and then Google (July 20, 2022). Facebook’s freeze is allegedly partial, targeting roles below L7 and excluding machine learning engineers. Google’s freeze is allegedly all-encompassing but may only last 2 weeks. But what’s actually going on? To make some sense of a bunch of contradictory information about Google’s and Facebook’s hiring freezes in the press and on Blind, we decided to ask the people who, outside of Google …Read more >Does communication matter in technical interviewing? We looked at 100K interviews to find out. By Dima Korolev | Published: May 18, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023The interviewing.io platform has hosted and collected feedback from over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity. But how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that talk is cheap. Read on to find out how and why.Read more >We analyzed 100K technical interviews to see where the best performers work. Here are the results.By Aline Lerner | Published: March 31, 2022; Last updated: March 28, 2024At interviewing.io, we’ve hosted over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. As it happens, we know where our users currently work – they tell us that when they sign up. Given that we have this data AND given that we know how well people do in their interviews, we thought it would be interesting to see which companies’ engineers are especially good at technical interviews. Our resulting top ten lists are in this post!Read more >Announcing our Pay Later Program: Don’t pay for mock interviews until you get a jobBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 9, 2022; Last updated: June 20, 2023In the wake of COVID, I made a public promise to launch a program where engineers could defer paying for practice until they found a job. Today, we’re making good on that promise by launching our Pay Later Program! With this program, you get instant credits to spend on interview practice and then pay us once you’ve found a job. And if you get a job through our job board, then you don’t have to pay anything…Read more >We’ve raised our Series A!By Aline Lerner | Published: October 19, 2021; Last updated: May 2, 2023I’m really excited to announce that we raised a $10M Series A, led by the fine people at M13. This round of funding is a long time coming. I don’t know what the average company age is when successfully raising an A, but it took us 6 years to get here. It was a long and windy path, and for a little while, we almost died (more on that below), but we’re still here, and we’re so grateful and excited to finally have the resources to do what we’ve always wanted to do: fix hiring, for real. What does “fixing hiring” mean? We believe that the only way to really effect change, is to make …Read more >Hamtips, or why I still run the Technical Phone Screen as the Hiring ManagerBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: October 6, 2021; Last updated: May 2, 2023“Hamtips” stands for “Hiring Manager Technical Phone Screen.” This combines two calls: the Technical Phone Screen (TPS), which is a coding exercise that usually happens before the onsite, and the HMS call, which is a call with the Hiring Manager. By combining these two steps you shorten the intro-to-offer by ~1 week and reduce candidate dropoff by 5-10%. It’s also a lot less work for recruiters playing scheduling battleship. Finally, Hiring Managers will, on average, be better at selling working at the company – it’s kind of their job.Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

Five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies. We’ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs. For the last year or so, we’ve also been running a Fellowship program specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds. That’s all to say that even though I have developed some strong opinions about “diversity hiring” initiatives, my opinions are based not on anecdotes but on cold, hard data. And the data points …Read more >The technical interview practice gap, and how it keeps underrepresented groups out of software engineeringBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 9, 2021; Last updated: May 24, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade, and five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies.

It’s an interesting question, and one I’m sure many of you job seekers out there are wondering. Internally, we have our own beliefs, but we wanted to see if we could answer this question more objectively. So we set off on a journey to acquire data to try answering it.Read more >Technical phone screen superforecastersBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: November 25, 2020; Last updated: July 14, 2023“The new VP wants us to double engineering’s headcount in the next six months. If we have a chance in hell to hit the hiring target, you seriously need to reconsider how fussy you’ve become.” It’s never good to have a recruiter ask engineers to lower their hiring bar, but he had a point. It can take upwards of 100 engineering hours to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire. Visnu and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the onsite pass rate went back up, and interviewing burnout receded. We didn’t lower the hiring bar, though. There was a better way.Read more >I’ve conducted over 600 technical interviews on interviewing.io. Here are 5 common problem areas I’ve seen.By Ian Douglas | Published: October 15, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I recently conducted my 600th interview on interviewing.io (IIO). I’d like to share lessons learned, why I approach interviews the way that I do, and shed some light on common problem areas I see happen in technical interviews. Every interviewer on the platform is different, and so your results may vary. We have some excellent folks helping out on the platform, and have a wonderful community working to better ourselves.Read more >6 red flags I saw while doing 60+ technical interviews in 30 daysBy Uduak Obong-Eren | Published: September 15, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023What is the one thing you would look out for if you had to join a company? Sometime between January and February 2020, I wanted to change jobs and was looking to join a new company. This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews – 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. Doing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.Read more >Announcing the interviewing.io Technical Interview Practice FellowshipBy Aline Lerner | Published: July 20, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io because I was frustrated with how inefficient and unfair hiring was and how much emphasis employers placed on resumes. But the problem is bigger than resumes. We’ve come to learn that interview practice matters just as much. The resume gets you in the door, and your interview performance is what gets you the offer. But, even though technical interviews are hard and scary for everyone — many of our users are senior engineers from FAANG who are terrified of getting back out there and code up the kinds of problems they don’t usually see at work while someone breathes down their neck — interview prep isn’t equitably distributed. This inequity never really …Read more >interviewing.io is finally out of beta. Anonymous technical interview practice for all!By Aline Lerner | Published: June 4, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io 5 years ago. After working as both an engineer and a recruiter, my frustration with how inefficient and unfair hiring had reached a boiling point. What made me especially angry was that despite mounting evidence that resumes are poor predictors of aptitude, employers were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously. In my mind, any great engineer, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to get their foot in the door wherever they choose. So, we set out to build a better system. On interviewing.io, software engineers can book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Facebook, Google, and others, and if …Read more >The Eng Hiring Bar: What the hell is it?By Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 31, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023Recursive Cactus has been working as a full-stack engineer at a well-known tech company for the past 5 years, but he’s now considering a career move.

Google’s interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Google’s interview process and questions\n\nGoogle’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call\n*   Technical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)\n*   Onsite\n*   Team matching\n\n![Google’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite, team matching](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fgoogle-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Google’s job interview process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nAll human organizations behave like a metaphor; Google isn’t a sports team, or a family, or an army. It’s a cool grad school. Larry and Sergey set up their offices based on the model of a Stanford campus on purpose. They wanted to create an environment and company culture where people can feel chill enough to talk about anything. In general, Google interviewers tend to be more collaborative than other FAANG interviewers. At Google, the slower you go, the faster you get there.\n\nGoogle has one big, centralized interview process that’s completely divorced from which team you might end up on, which means that you will NOT, however, be interviewing with your future team members – Google has a horde of interchangeable technical interviewers who have all been trained on the same process. If you do well, there will be a team matching component at the end.\n\nAt Google, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently, which means you don’t get multiple shots on goal. Not only that, but Google has a limit for how many chances they’ll give you before you’re blocked from interviewing again.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“You can interview three times in 5 years. If you fail all three times then you can’t interview at Google again: you’re blocked.”\n\nNote that recently, there have been rumblings of Google changing their process to something more decentralized, where a hiring manager chooses you for a team _before_ you interview, nullifying the need for post-onsite team matching. As far as we know, this new model is being tried out right now, but the change hasn’t been adopted company-wide.\n\nGoogle also has rules for candidates who _pass_ their interviews:\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“If you pass Google’s onsite, and end up not taking the offer, your “passing of the onsite '' is good for about a year. And if you choose to re-engage in that time, the process varies widely. Usually you can skip the phone interview. Most times you have to do the full or partial onsite. If you choose to re-engage, tell their recruiters ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get as many steps skipped as you can.”\n\nGoogle is not results-oriented. They’re process oriented. In other words, they care more about the “How” than the “What”. You’ve heard it before, and it’s true – they don’t need you to get to the optimal solution, but they do need to be impressed by your thought process. Because of this, Google is more attracted to comfort with ambiguity than speed.\n\nOddly, in spite of using a centralized interview process, Google doesn’t have in-depth training for its interviewers; it may surprise some candidates that there’s a larger-than-expected number of bad interviewers at Google.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“There is one thing that always bothered me about the Google interview process. And it's something that a lot of candidates don’t realize. There are a lot of bad interviewers at Google. Mostly because there are a lot of highly talented people who think they know everything.\n\nI was the interviewer for the third interview round at in-person onsite. And I saw the candidate was there by himself; the second interviewer wasn’t there. The candidate was alone because the second interviewer got frustrated – they thought the candidate wasn’t worth the time for an onsite, so they left early.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Interviewer Who Worked at Google and Facebook\n\n“Google is more likely than Facebook to design questions on purpose to be tricky. At Google, sometimes this is intentionally disguising technical questions to look like X but they’re really Y. And other times at Google, it’s designing a technical question such that if a candidate doesn’t ask a particular question they likely won’t get the answer.”\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nGoogle’s technical phone screen is a coding interview that focuses exclusively on data structures and algorithms questions. Your interviewer will ask you to write code to solve a specific problem.\n\nOne idiosyncratic aspect of Google’s process is their insistence on using Google docs for writing code (versus other companies which tend to use tools like CoderPad). This can be a bit jarring for those of us who are used to writing code in an IDE that does things like auto-indentation, auto-complete, syntax highlighting, adding missing parentheses or brackets etc. Despite not using an IDE, your interviewer will expect you to produce syntactically correct code. This is really hard.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nBefore your Google interview, you should practice in Google docs so you don’t forget to close parentheses or indent your code.\n\nThat said, more recently, Google has started interviewing using an internal tool with syntax highlighting, indentation and brackets completion. Whether you get to use it or not depends on your geography.\n\n### Step 2.5: (In some cases) Another technical phone screen\n\nThe second phone screen happens only if the first one did not produce enough signal to move forward. Perhaps you didn’t communicate your thought process well enough, your code wasn’t of good enough quality, or you weren’t fast enough – but it’ll be only one of these – if you struggled with two or all three, most likely you aren’t moving forward.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you do get scheduled for a second phone screen, push your recruiter to give you detailed feedback so you can do better the second time – nothing beats knowing _exactly_ where you need to improve. You probably won’t get a response, but if you do it’s a large boost to your prep.\n\nIf you get a second phone screen it will be very similar to the first in terms of structure and content.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe Google onsite usually includes 4-6 rounds. Recently, there have been some internal experiments with the format, but generally the rounds are primarily coding, and secondarily system design. Some candidates get a single behavioral round, and others get to skip it.\n\nThe more experience you have, the higher proportion of system design and domain-specific questions you can expect to be asked.\n\n## Google’s interview types in detail\n\nAs we mentioned above, Google is process-oriented rather than results-oriented. As such, communication during coding and system design rounds is more important at Google than the end result.\n\n### Coding\n\n**The most important rounds at Google are coding. In fact, Google is the only FAANG company that considers coding to be more important than system design**. Google’s coding rounds are about complexity more than speed. Their interviewers are allowed to ask anything they want, so it's more likely you might get a question you’ve never practiced before.\n\nGoogle interviewers are more likely than any other FAANG company to purposefully design a question so it tricks candidates. For example, they’ll disguise a question to look like it’s Three Sum, but that’s a red herring – it’s not a Three Sum problem. It just looks like one.\n\nA lot of what you’ll see in the onsite coding mirrors what you saw in the technical phone screen. During the onsite, you may see your interviewer layer more complexity on top of questions – they’ll design a question where they plan for you to get to the solution, then when you do they’ll move the goalposts and say something like: “Remember that assumption we made earlier about \\[X thing\\]? Let’s remove that. How would that change your approach?”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“At Google, I’ve passed more people that _arrive at the optimal solution without coding it_ than I do people who _arrive at the optimal solution and code it_. The actual code you write is less important than the thought process.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“Google is highly unstructured. Everyone can ask whatever they want.”\n\nEven though they can ask whatever they want, Google interviewers have a question bank too, but the bank is much much bigger than Facebook’s bank and, like Facebook’s bank, it’s community maintained. Some interviewers never deviate from the bank, and others don’t touch it, preferring instead to formulate their own unique questions..\n\nThis speaks to Google rewarding the “how” (aka “how a candidate got there”) or their thought processes. It also speaks to Google rewarding comfort with ambiguity. Other FAANGs have specific niche topics they love hearing and talking about (such as “performance” at Amazon), but Google is more abstract. Google might love speaking about and asking about ambiguity more than any other FAANG.\n\nFinally, Google’s coding questions are never practical. They are always theoretical. They will never ask you to pull up your own environment and write a program. They will also never ask you to take a solution to a coding problem and apply it to a real world scenario. When prepping for Google, only practice theoretical questions.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Google’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Google coding interview preparation resources](#google-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nThe second most important onsite interview type at Google is system design. Again, they are allowed to ask anything they want, so don’t be scared off if you get a question you’ve never practiced before.\n\nHigh-level and low-level system design questions are both likely. Some examples include:\n\n*   Design a load balancer\n*   Design Facebook Messenger\n*   Design an auth platform\n\nGoogle system design interviewers also tend to design problems that include linchpin questions. These are questions where if you don’t ask about a specific aspect of the problem, you can’t really solve it. For example, an older system design question at Google asked you to set up a service in some foreign country, and in the prompt, the interviewer mentioned that you have a dependency on some third party service.\n\nThe linchpin question to ask: “What’s the service level agreement for that 3rd party service?” If you didn’t ask that (or something like it), then you wouldn’t be able to effectively reason about availability, which you’d need to do in order to do well on the question.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nTo avoid getting tricked, ask even more questions in Google system design rounds than you normally would.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThe least important round at Google is the behavioral round. They have the easiest behavioral screen in FAANG. Plus, you might complete an onsite at Google without a behavioral round because they’re optional. It’s not clear which candidates get them and which don’t. This is another reason to not prep too hard for their behavioral round.\n\nIf you do get some behavioral questions, they might be one of the following:\n\n*   Tell me about a time when you had a colleague who was difficult to work with.\n*   Tell me about a time you received negative feedback.\n*   Tell me about a time you were mentoring a more junior engineer and your feedback wasn’t getting through to them.\n*   If you were going to plan an offsite for the team, how would you do it?\n\nGoogle is also more likely to ask you reflective questions. Most other FAANGs stick to situational questions such as, “Tell me of a time when…”. Those situational questions ask you to describe a past circumstance or scenario you’ve actually experienced and are fairly straightforward to answer. Reflective questions, on the other hand, can be tricky because they’re asking you to reflect on, or speak to, something less concrete, e.g., “What do you think about setting goals?”\n\nThe smart way to answer a reflective question is to re-formulate it, and then answer as if it’s a situational question. So, “What do you think about setting goals” instead becomes,”Talk about a time you used goal-setting as a time management strategy”, which you can now more-easily answer by describing a real experience and outcome, “The last time I set goals…etc”, as opposed to wading into theories about personal agency. “I think goals are cool and important…” might not get high marks.\n\n### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“To be honest, there was some cultural backlash at Google when they announced that we had to do these behavioral interviews. What that means is you may get an interviewer who has very little interest in conducting this type of interview. Which could go very good or very bad. I have some peers who think this should not be a part of the interview process. So they give everyone the highest marks, pretty much just to eliminate this category from the interview. Google is primarily engineers, and most of the engineers think that this is a bunch of HR BS. So they either just won’t accept any calendar invites they get or they'll just check the boxes.”\n\n## How Google makes hiring decisions\n\nMost of the time, the post-interview feedback process at Google is completely asynchronous, and interviewers don’t meet live to discuss hiring decisions. That’s one reason why interviewing at Google isn’t like interviewing with humans: it’s more akin to interviewing with a machine.\n\nEach interviewer rates candidates on the following seven-point scale: Strong No-Hire, No Hire, Leaning No-Hire, On The Fence, Leaning Hire, Hire, and Strong Hire.\n\nHow this affects candidates is simple: a Strong Hire can get you an offer, but it can also buy you a second chance. If you don’t get an offer, but you get a Strong Hire from one of your interviewers, you might be offered one bonus interview round to decide whether you get an offer or not.\n\nThat said, you don’t need to get a “Strong Hire” to get a second chance. Overall, if you showed enough signal to not-fail but not enough to pass, sometimes they will ask you to do an additional round.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you get lucky enough to get a round where you are really excelling, don’t quit while you’re ahead. Keep going. In that round, don’t just strive to win; strive for total domination.\n\nA “Strong No-Hire” bars you from interviewing at Google for some time. Reports vary here, but one of our Google interviewers told us that if you get a Strong No-Hire, you might be frozen out for several years.\n\nIf you passed overall then you will move on to the hiring committee phase.\n\n### Hiring committee review & team matching\n\nGoogle’s hiring committee consists of four to five engineers and engineering managers who have not interviewed you, with the intent of making hiring decisions as objective as possible.\n\nGoing into the hiring committee review, your recruiter will prepare a packet that consists of your resume, any notes from the person who referred you (if you were referred), your recruiter’s notes from their call with you, and all the feedback from your interviewers, from the technical phone screen to the onsite.\n\n#### Resume screening tip\n\nIf you’re told you’ve passed the onsite, ask if you can submit a more recent copy of your resume. Some Google recruiters will let your new resume be the only resume the Hiring Committee sees. Your resume you submitted for the online application probably wasn’t customized for Google, but what you submit to the hiring committee can be.\n\nWhen the committee meets, they evaluate all the data on you holistically, and they need a consensus in order to decide to make a hire.\n\nOther than hire/no-hire decisions, the hiring committee will also decide on leveling. Ever since COVID and the rise of remote interviewing, we’ve gotten more and more reports from users that they’re being down-leveled at Google. Apparently the rationale is that Google doesn’t feel like they get as much signal from remote interviews as they did from in-person ones, and as such, when they don’t get enough of a signal for a hire but too much good signal for a rejection: they downlevel – when you want to reduce the probability of a false positives for L5… offer L4!\n\nEngineers who are downleveled at Google accept the lower level offer a lot of the time, especially in the current climate. In some extreme cases, we’ve seen engineering managers with 10+ YoE accept an L3 (basically a new grad) offer.\n\nOnce you get past the hiring committee, you will move on to team matching. The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. In the ideal case, your recruiter will propose a few teams that are actively looking for someone with your skills, and then you’ll meet with the hiring manager from each team to gauge cultural fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.\n\nThat said, there are rare instances where a candidate will get past the hiring committee but then not find a team that they gel with.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“Getting five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’ is most likely to result in a ‘No Hire’ decision. I have seen many cases where the candidates got five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’, and the recruiter gave them positive feedback too, but the candidate got rejected. In these cases, every person the candidate dealt with directly (the interviewers) were positive, yet the hiring committee (the only people in the process who dealt with the candidate indirectly) rejected the candidate.”\n\n## Google coding interview preparation resources\n\nHere are some tips for preparing for your Google coding interview:\n\n*   Practice in teams; have someone make up a question. Then have them disguise it or plant a red herring in it (for example, purposefully have it look like Three Sum, but it isn’t Three Sum).\n*   Practice with someone who can change the parameters after you’ve solved the main question by saying things like “Remember that assumption X we made earlier. What would happen if we removed that assumption?”\n*   If you see a question online that has been marked as “Asked in a Google interview”, then it is not going to be asked in your interview, period. Google is very good at retiring questions that have been leaked.\n*   Practice without the aid of an editor or IDE: in a Google doc, on a whiteboard, or with pen and paper.\n\nIn addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Google content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Google interviewers, long-form solutions to common Google questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Google interviews.\n\n### Google interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Google interviewers on our platform.

Google’s interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Google’s interview process and questions\n\nGoogle’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call\n*   Technical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)\n*   Onsite\n*   Team matching\n\n![Google’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite, team matching](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fgoogle-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Google’s job interview process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nAll human organizations behave like a metaphor; Google isn’t a sports team, or a family, or an army. It’s a cool grad school. Larry and Sergey set up their offices based on the model of a Stanford campus on purpose. They wanted to create an environment and company culture where people can feel chill enough to talk about anything. In general, Google interviewers tend to be more collaborative than other FAANG interviewers. At Google, the slower you go, the faster you get there.\n\nGoogle has one big, centralized interview process that’s completely divorced from which team you might end up on, which means that you will NOT, however, be interviewing with your future team members – Google has a horde of interchangeable technical interviewers who have all been trained on the same process. If you do well, there will be a team matching component at the end.\n\nAt Google, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently, which means you don’t get multiple shots on goal. Not only that, but Google has a limit for how many chances they’ll give you before you’re blocked from interviewing again.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“You can interview three times in 5 years. If you fail all three times then you can’t interview at Google again: you’re blocked.”\n\nNote that recently, there have been rumblings of Google changing their process to something more decentralized, where a hiring manager chooses you for a team _before_ you interview, nullifying the need for post-onsite team matching. As far as we know, this new model is being tried out right now, but the change hasn’t been adopted company-wide.\n\nGoogle also has rules for candidates who _pass_ their interviews:\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“If you pass Google’s onsite, and end up not taking the offer, your “passing of the onsite '' is good for about a year. And if you choose to re-engage in that time, the process varies widely. Usually you can skip the phone interview. Most times you have to do the full or partial onsite. If you choose to re-engage, tell their recruiters ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get as many steps skipped as you can.”\n\nGoogle is not results-oriented. They’re process oriented. In other words, they care more about the “How” than the “What”. You’ve heard it before, and it’s true – they don’t need you to get to the optimal solution, but they do need to be impressed by your thought process. Because of this, Google is more attracted to comfort with ambiguity than speed.\n\nOddly, in spite of using a centralized interview process, Google doesn’t have in-depth training for its interviewers; it may surprise some candidates that there’s a larger-than-expected number of bad interviewers at Google.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“There is one thing that always bothered me about the Google interview process. And it's something that a lot of candidates don’t realize. There are a lot of bad interviewers at Google. Mostly because there are a lot of highly talented people who think they know everything.\n\nI was the interviewer for the third interview round at in-person onsite. And I saw the candidate was there by himself; the second interviewer wasn’t there. The candidate was alone because the second interviewer got frustrated – they thought the candidate wasn’t worth the time for an onsite, so they left early.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Interviewer Who Worked at Google and Facebook\n\n“Google is more likely than Facebook to design questions on purpose to be tricky. At Google, sometimes this is intentionally disguising technical questions to look like X but they’re really Y. And other times at Google, it’s designing a technical question such that if a candidate doesn’t ask a particular question they likely won’t get the answer.”\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nGoogle’s technical phone screen is a coding interview that focuses exclusively on data structures and algorithms questions. Your interviewer will ask you to write code to solve a specific problem.\n\nOne idiosyncratic aspect of Google’s process is their insistence on using Google docs for writing code (versus other companies which tend to use tools like CoderPad). This can be a bit jarring for those of us who are used to writing code in an IDE that does things like auto-indentation, auto-complete, syntax highlighting, adding missing parentheses or brackets etc. Despite not using an IDE, your interviewer will expect you to produce syntactically correct code. This is really hard.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nBefore your Google interview, you should practice in Google docs so you don’t forget to close parentheses or indent your code.\n\nThat said, more recently, Google has started interviewing using an internal tool with syntax highlighting, indentation and brackets completion. Whether you get to use it or not depends on your geography.\n\n### Step 2.5: (In some cases) Another technical phone screen\n\nThe second phone screen happens only if the first one did not produce enough signal to move forward. Perhaps you didn’t communicate your thought process well enough, your code wasn’t of good enough quality, or you weren’t fast enough – but it’ll be only one of these – if you struggled with two or all three, most likely you aren’t moving forward.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you do get scheduled for a second phone screen, push your recruiter to give you detailed feedback so you can do better the second time – nothing beats knowing _exactly_ where you need to improve. You probably won’t get a response, but if you do it’s a large boost to your prep.\n\nIf you get a second phone screen it will be very similar to the first in terms of structure and content.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe Google onsite usually includes 4-6 rounds. Recently, there have been some internal experiments with the format, but generally the rounds are primarily coding, and secondarily system design. Some candidates get a single behavioral round, and others get to skip it.\n\nThe more experience you have, the higher proportion of system design and domain-specific questions you can expect to be asked.\n\n## Google’s interview types in detail\n\nAs we mentioned above, Google is process-oriented rather than results-oriented. As such, communication during coding and system design rounds is more important at Google than the end result.\n\n### Coding\n\n**The most important rounds at Google are coding. In fact, Google is the only FAANG company that considers coding to be more important than system design**. Google’s coding rounds are about complexity more than speed. Their interviewers are allowed to ask anything they want, so it's more likely you might get a question you’ve never practiced before.\n\nGoogle interviewers are more likely than any other FAANG company to purposefully design a question so it tricks candidates. For example, they’ll disguise a question to look like it’s Three Sum, but that’s a red herring – it’s not a Three Sum problem. It just looks like one.\n\nA lot of what you’ll see in the onsite coding mirrors what you saw in the technical phone screen. During the onsite, you may see your interviewer layer more complexity on top of questions – they’ll design a question where they plan for you to get to the solution, then when you do they’ll move the goalposts and say something like: “Remember that assumption we made earlier about \\[X thing\\]? Let’s remove that. How would that change your approach?”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“At Google, I’ve passed more people that _arrive at the optimal solution without coding it_ than I do people who _arrive at the optimal solution and code it_. The actual code you write is less important than the thought process.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“Google is highly unstructured. Everyone can ask whatever they want.”\n\nEven though they can ask whatever they want, Google interviewers have a question bank too, but the bank is much much bigger than Facebook’s bank and, like Facebook’s bank, it’s community maintained. Some interviewers never deviate from the bank, and others don’t touch it, preferring instead to formulate their own unique questions..\n\nThis speaks to Google rewarding the “how” (aka “how a candidate got there”) or their thought processes. It also speaks to Google rewarding comfort with ambiguity. Other FAANGs have specific niche topics they love hearing and talking about (such as “performance” at Amazon), but Google is more abstract. Google might love speaking about and asking about ambiguity more than any other FAANG.\n\nFinally, Google’s coding questions are never practical. They are always theoretical. They will never ask you to pull up your own environment and write a program. They will also never ask you to take a solution to a coding problem and apply it to a real world scenario. When prepping for Google, only practice theoretical questions.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Google’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Google coding interview preparation resources](#google-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nThe second most important onsite interview type at Google is system design. Again, they are allowed to ask anything they want, so don’t be scared off if you get a question you’ve never practiced before.\n\nHigh-level and low-level system design questions are both likely. Some examples include:\n\n*   Design a load balancer\n*   Design Facebook Messenger\n*   Design an auth platform\n\nGoogle system design interviewers also tend to design problems that include linchpin questions. These are questions where if you don’t ask about a specific aspect of the problem, you can’t really solve it. For example, an older system design question at Google asked you to set up a service in some foreign country, and in the prompt, the interviewer mentioned that you have a dependency on some third party service.\n\nThe linchpin question to ask: “What’s the service level agreement for that 3rd party service?” If you didn’t ask that (or something like it), then you wouldn’t be able to effectively reason about availability, which you’d need to do in order to do well on the question.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nTo avoid getting tricked, ask even more questions in Google system design rounds than you normally would.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThe least important round at Google is the behavioral round. They have the easiest behavioral screen in FAANG. Plus, you might complete an onsite at Google without a behavioral round because they’re optional. It’s not clear which candidates get them and which don’t. This is another reason to not prep too hard for their behavioral round.\n\nIf you do get some behavioral questions, they might be one of the following:\n\n*   Tell me about a time when you had a colleague who was difficult to work with.\n*   Tell me about a time you received negative feedback.\n*   Tell me about a time you were mentoring a more junior engineer and your feedback wasn’t getting through to them.\n*   If you were going to plan an offsite for the team, how would you do it?\n\nGoogle is also more likely to ask you reflective questions. Most other FAANGs stick to situational questions such as, “Tell me of a time when…”. Those situational questions ask you to describe a past circumstance or scenario you’ve actually experienced and are fairly straightforward to answer. Reflective questions, on the other hand, can be tricky because they’re asking you to reflect on, or speak to, something less concrete, e.g., “What do you think about setting goals?”\n\nThe smart way to answer a reflective question is to re-formulate it, and then answer as if it’s a situational question. So, “What do you think about setting goals” instead becomes,”Talk about a time you used goal-setting as a time management strategy”, which you can now more-easily answer by describing a real experience and outcome, “The last time I set goals…etc”, as opposed to wading into theories about personal agency. “I think goals are cool and important…” might not get high marks.\n\n### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“To be honest, there was some cultural backlash at Google when they announced that we had to do these behavioral interviews. What that means is you may get an interviewer who has very little interest in conducting this type of interview. Which could go very good or very bad. I have some peers who think this should not be a part of the interview process. So they give everyone the highest marks, pretty much just to eliminate this category from the interview. Google is primarily engineers, and most of the engineers think that this is a bunch of HR BS. So they either just won’t accept any calendar invites they get or they'll just check the boxes.”\n\n## How Google makes hiring decisions\n\nMost of the time, the post-interview feedback process at Google is completely asynchronous, and interviewers don’t meet live to discuss hiring decisions. That’s one reason why interviewing at Google isn’t like interviewing with humans: it’s more akin to interviewing with a machine.\n\nEach interviewer rates candidates on the following seven-point scale: Strong No-Hire, No Hire, Leaning No-Hire, On The Fence, Leaning Hire, Hire, and Strong Hire.\n\nHow this affects candidates is simple: a Strong Hire can get you an offer, but it can also buy you a second chance. If you don’t get an offer, but you get a Strong Hire from one of your interviewers, you might be offered one bonus interview round to decide whether you get an offer or not.\n\nThat said, you don’t need to get a “Strong Hire” to get a second chance. Overall, if you showed enough signal to not-fail but not enough to pass, sometimes they will ask you to do an additional round.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you get lucky enough to get a round where you are really excelling, don’t quit while you’re ahead. Keep going. In that round, don’t just strive to win; strive for total domination.\n\nA “Strong No-Hire” bars you from interviewing at Google for some time. Reports vary here, but one of our Google interviewers told us that if you get a Strong No-Hire, you might be frozen out for several years.\n\nIf you passed overall then you will move on to the hiring committee phase.\n\n### Hiring committee review & team matching\n\nGoogle’s hiring committee consists of four to five engineers and engineering managers who have not interviewed you, with the intent of making hiring decisions as objective as possible.\n\nGoing into the hiring committee review, your recruiter will prepare a packet that consists of your resume, any notes from the person who referred you (if you were referred), your recruiter’s notes from their call with you, and all the feedback from your interviewers, from the technical phone screen to the onsite.\n\n#### Resume screening tip\n\nIf you’re told you’ve passed the onsite, ask if you can submit a more recent copy of your resume. Some Google recruiters will let your new resume be the only resume the Hiring Committee sees. Your resume you submitted for the online application probably wasn’t customized for Google, but what you submit to the hiring committee can be.\n\nWhen the committee meets, they evaluate all the data on you holistically, and they need a consensus in order to decide to make a hire.\n\nOther than hire/no-hire decisions, the hiring committee will also decide on leveling. Ever since COVID and the rise of remote interviewing, we’ve gotten more and more reports from users that they’re being down-leveled at Google. Apparently the rationale is that Google doesn’t feel like they get as much signal from remote interviews as they did from in-person ones, and as such, when they don’t get enough of a signal for a hire but too much good signal for a rejection: they downlevel – when you want to reduce the probability of a false positives for L5… offer L4!\n\nEngineers who are downleveled at Google accept the lower level offer a lot of the time, especially in the current climate. In some extreme cases, we’ve seen engineering managers with 10+ YoE accept an L3 (basically a new grad) offer.\n\nOnce you get past the hiring committee, you will move on to team matching. The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. In the ideal case, your recruiter will propose a few teams that are actively looking for someone with your skills, and then you’ll meet with the hiring manager from each team to gauge cultural fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.\n\nThat said, there are rare instances where a candidate will get past the hiring committee but then not find a team that they gel with.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“Getting five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’ is most likely to result in a ‘No Hire’ decision. I have seen many cases where the candidates got five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’, and the recruiter gave them positive feedback too, but the candidate got rejected. In these cases, every person the candidate dealt with directly (the interviewers) were positive, yet the hiring committee (the only people in the process who dealt with the candidate indirectly) rejected the candidate.”\n\n## Google coding interview preparation resources\n\nHere are some tips for preparing for your Google coding interview:\n\n*   Practice in teams; have someone make up a question. Then have them disguise it or plant a red herring in it (for example, purposefully have it look like Three Sum, but it isn’t Three Sum).\n*   Practice with someone who can change the parameters after you’ve solved the main question by saying things like “Remember that assumption X we made earlier. What would happen if we removed that assumption?”\n*   If you see a question online that has been marked as “Asked in a Google interview”, then it is not going to be asked in your interview, period. Google is very good at retiring questions that have been leaked.\n*   Practice without the aid of an editor or IDE: in a Google doc, on a whiteboard, or with pen and paper.\n\nIn addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Google content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Google interviewers, long-form solutions to common Google questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Google interviews.\n\n### Google interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Google interviewers on our platform.

Google’s interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Google’s interview process and questions\n\nGoogle’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call\n*   Technical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)\n*   Onsite\n*   Team matching\n\n![Google’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite, team matching](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fgoogle-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Google’s job interview process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nAll human organizations behave like a metaphor; Google isn’t a sports team, or a family, or an army. It’s a cool grad school. Larry and Sergey set up their offices based on the model of a Stanford campus on purpose. They wanted to create an environment and company culture where people can feel chill enough to talk about anything. In general, Google interviewers tend to be more collaborative than other FAANG interviewers. At Google, the slower you go, the faster you get there.\n\nGoogle has one big, centralized interview process that’s completely divorced from which team you might end up on, which means that you will NOT, however, be interviewing with your future team members – Google has a horde of interchangeable technical interviewers who have all been trained on the same process. If you do well, there will be a team matching component at the end.\n\nAt Google, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently, which means you don’t get multiple shots on goal. Not only that, but Google has a limit for how many chances they’ll give you before you’re blocked from interviewing again.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“You can interview three times in 5 years. If you fail all three times then you can’t interview at Google again: you’re blocked.”\n\nNote that recently, there have been rumblings of Google changing their process to something more decentralized, where a hiring manager chooses you for a team _before_ you interview, nullifying the need for post-onsite team matching. As far as we know, this new model is being tried out right now, but the change hasn’t been adopted company-wide.\n\nGoogle also has rules for candidates who _pass_ their interviews:\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“If you pass Google’s onsite, and end up not taking the offer, your “passing of the onsite '' is good for about a year. And if you choose to re-engage in that time, the process varies widely. Usually you can skip the phone interview. Most times you have to do the full or partial onsite. If you choose to re-engage, tell their recruiters ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get as many steps skipped as you can.”\n\nGoogle is not results-oriented. They’re process oriented. In other words, they care more about the “How” than the “What”. You’ve heard it before, and it’s true – they don’t need you to get to the optimal solution, but they do need to be impressed by your thought process. Because of this, Google is more attracted to comfort with ambiguity than speed.\n\nOddly, in spite of using a centralized interview process, Google doesn’t have in-depth training for its interviewers; it may surprise some candidates that there’s a larger-than-expected number of bad interviewers at Google.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“There is one thing that always bothered me about the Google interview process. And it's something that a lot of candidates don’t realize. There are a lot of bad interviewers at Google. Mostly because there are a lot of highly talented people who think they know everything.\n\nI was the interviewer for the third interview round at in-person onsite. And I saw the candidate was there by himself; the second interviewer wasn’t there. The candidate was alone because the second interviewer got frustrated – they thought the candidate wasn’t worth the time for an onsite, so they left early.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Interviewer Who Worked at Google and Facebook\n\n“Google is more likely than Facebook to design questions on purpose to be tricky. At Google, sometimes this is intentionally disguising technical questions to look like X but they’re really Y. And other times at Google, it’s designing a technical question such that if a candidate doesn’t ask a particular question they likely won’t get the answer.”\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nGoogle’s technical phone screen is a coding interview that focuses exclusively on data structures and algorithms questions. Your interviewer will ask you to write code to solve a specific problem.\n\nOne idiosyncratic aspect of Google’s process is their insistence on using Google docs for writing code (versus other companies which tend to use tools like CoderPad). This can be a bit jarring for those of us who are used to writing code in an IDE that does things like auto-indentation, auto-complete, syntax highlighting, adding missing parentheses or brackets etc. Despite not using an IDE, your interviewer will expect you to produce syntactically correct code. This is really hard.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nBefore your Google interview, you should practice in Google docs so you don’t forget to close parentheses or indent your code.\n\nThat said, more recently, Google has started interviewing using an internal tool with syntax highlighting, indentation and brackets completion. Whether you get to use it or not depends on your geography.\n\n### Step 2.5: (In some cases) Another technical phone screen\n\nThe second phone screen happens only if the first one did not produce enough signal to move forward. Perhaps you didn’t communicate your thought process well enough, your code wasn’t of good enough quality, or you weren’t fast enough – but it’ll be only one of these – if you struggled with two or all three, most likely you aren’t moving forward.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you do get scheduled for a second phone screen, push your recruiter to give you detailed feedback so you can do better the second time – nothing beats knowing _exactly_ where you need to improve. You probably won’t get a response, but if you do it’s a large boost to your prep.\n\nIf you get a second phone screen it will be very similar to the first in terms of structure and content.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe Google onsite usually includes 4-6 rounds. Recently, there have been some internal experiments with the format, but generally the rounds are primarily coding, and secondarily system design. Some candidates get a single behavioral round, and others get to skip it.\n\nThe more experience you have, the higher proportion of system design and domain-specific questions you can expect to be asked.\n\n## Google’s interview types in detail\n\nAs we mentioned above, Google is process-oriented rather than results-oriented. As such, communication during coding and system design rounds is more important at Google than the end result.\n\n### Coding\n\n**The most important rounds at Google are coding. In fact, Google is the only FAANG company that considers coding to be more important than system design**. Google’s coding rounds are about complexity more than speed. Their interviewers are allowed to ask anything they want, so it's more likely you might get a question you’ve never practiced before.\n\nGoogle interviewers are more likely than any other FAANG company to purposefully design a question so it tricks candidates. For example, they’ll disguise a question to look like it’s Three Sum, but that’s a red herring – it’s not a Three Sum problem. It just looks like one.\n\nA lot of what you’ll see in the onsite coding mirrors what you saw in the technical phone screen. During the onsite, you may see your interviewer layer more complexity on top of questions – they’ll design a question where they plan for you to get to the solution, then when you do they’ll move the goalposts and say something like: “Remember that assumption we made earlier about \\[X thing\\]? Let’s remove that. How would that change your approach?”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“At Google, I’ve passed more people that _arrive at the optimal solution without coding it_ than I do people who _arrive at the optimal solution and code it_. The actual code you write is less important than the thought process.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“Google is highly unstructured. Everyone can ask whatever they want.”\n\nEven though they can ask whatever they want, Google interviewers have a question bank too, but the bank is much much bigger than Facebook’s bank and, like Facebook’s bank, it’s community maintained. Some interviewers never deviate from the bank, and others don’t touch it, preferring instead to formulate their own unique questions..\n\nThis speaks to Google rewarding the “how” (aka “how a candidate got there”) or their thought processes. It also speaks to Google rewarding comfort with ambiguity. Other FAANGs have specific niche topics they love hearing and talking about (such as “performance” at Amazon), but Google is more abstract. Google might love speaking about and asking about ambiguity more than any other FAANG.\n\nFinally, Google’s coding questions are never practical. They are always theoretical. They will never ask you to pull up your own environment and write a program. They will also never ask you to take a solution to a coding problem and apply it to a real world scenario. When prepping for Google, only practice theoretical questions.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Google’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Google coding interview preparation resources](#google-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nThe second most important onsite interview type at Google is system design. Again, they are allowed to ask anything they want, so don’t be scared off if you get a question you’ve never practiced before.\n\nHigh-level and low-level system design questions are both likely. Some examples include:\n\n*   Design a load balancer\n*   Design Facebook Messenger\n*   Design an auth platform\n\nGoogle system design interviewers also tend to design problems that include linchpin questions. These are questions where if you don’t ask about a specific aspect of the problem, you can’t really solve it. For example, an older system design question at Google asked you to set up a service in some foreign country, and in the prompt, the interviewer mentioned that you have a dependency on some third party service.\n\nThe linchpin question to ask: “What’s the service level agreement for that 3rd party service?” If you didn’t ask that (or something like it), then you wouldn’t be able to effectively reason about availability, which you’d need to do in order to do well on the question.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nTo avoid getting tricked, ask even more questions in Google system design rounds than you normally would.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThe least important round at Google is the behavioral round. They have the easiest behavioral screen in FAANG. Plus, you might complete an onsite at Google without a behavioral round because they’re optional. It’s not clear which candidates get them and which don’t. This is another reason to not prep too hard for their behavioral round.\n\nIf you do get some behavioral questions, they might be one of the following:\n\n*   Tell me about a time when you had a colleague who was difficult to work with.\n*   Tell me about a time you received negative feedback.\n*   Tell me about a time you were mentoring a more junior engineer and your feedback wasn’t getting through to them.\n*   If you were going to plan an offsite for the team, how would you do it?\n\nGoogle is also more likely to ask you reflective questions. Most other FAANGs stick to situational questions such as, “Tell me of a time when…”. Those situational questions ask you to describe a past circumstance or scenario you’ve actually experienced and are fairly straightforward to answer. Reflective questions, on the other hand, can be tricky because they’re asking you to reflect on, or speak to, something less concrete, e.g., “What do you think about setting goals?”\n\nThe smart way to answer a reflective question is to re-formulate it, and then answer as if it’s a situational question. So, “What do you think about setting goals” instead becomes,”Talk about a time you used goal-setting as a time management strategy”, which you can now more-easily answer by describing a real experience and outcome, “The last time I set goals…etc”, as opposed to wading into theories about personal agency. “I think goals are cool and important…” might not get high marks.\n\n### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“To be honest, there was some cultural backlash at Google when they announced that we had to do these behavioral interviews. What that means is you may get an interviewer who has very little interest in conducting this type of interview. Which could go very good or very bad. I have some peers who think this should not be a part of the interview process. So they give everyone the highest marks, pretty much just to eliminate this category from the interview. Google is primarily engineers, and most of the engineers think that this is a bunch of HR BS. So they either just won’t accept any calendar invites they get or they'll just check the boxes.”\n\n## How Google makes hiring decisions\n\nMost of the time, the post-interview feedback process at Google is completely asynchronous, and interviewers don’t meet live to discuss hiring decisions. That’s one reason why interviewing at Google isn’t like interviewing with humans: it’s more akin to interviewing with a machine.\n\nEach interviewer rates candidates on the following seven-point scale: Strong No-Hire, No Hire, Leaning No-Hire, On The Fence, Leaning Hire, Hire, and Strong Hire.\n\nHow this affects candidates is simple: a Strong Hire can get you an offer, but it can also buy you a second chance. If you don’t get an offer, but you get a Strong Hire from one of your interviewers, you might be offered one bonus interview round to decide whether you get an offer or not.\n\nThat said, you don’t need to get a “Strong Hire” to get a second chance. Overall, if you showed enough signal to not-fail but not enough to pass, sometimes they will ask you to do an additional round.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you get lucky enough to get a round where you are really excelling, don’t quit while you’re ahead. Keep going. In that round, don’t just strive to win; strive for total domination.\n\nA “Strong No-Hire” bars you from interviewing at Google for some time. Reports vary here, but one of our Google interviewers told us that if you get a Strong No-Hire, you might be frozen out for several years.\n\nIf you passed overall then you will move on to the hiring committee phase.\n\n### Hiring committee review & team matching\n\nGoogle’s hiring committee consists of four to five engineers and engineering managers who have not interviewed you, with the intent of making hiring decisions as objective as possible.\n\nGoing into the hiring committee review, your recruiter will prepare a packet that consists of your resume, any notes from the person who referred you (if you were referred), your recruiter’s notes from their call with you, and all the feedback from your interviewers, from the technical phone screen to the onsite.\n\n#### Resume screening tip\n\nIf you’re told you’ve passed the onsite, ask if you can submit a more recent copy of your resume. Some Google recruiters will let your new resume be the only resume the Hiring Committee sees. Your resume you submitted for the online application probably wasn’t customized for Google, but what you submit to the hiring committee can be.\n\nWhen the committee meets, they evaluate all the data on you holistically, and they need a consensus in order to decide to make a hire.\n\nOther than hire/no-hire decisions, the hiring committee will also decide on leveling. Ever since COVID and the rise of remote interviewing, we’ve gotten more and more reports from users that they’re being down-leveled at Google. Apparently the rationale is that Google doesn’t feel like they get as much signal from remote interviews as they did from in-person ones, and as such, when they don’t get enough of a signal for a hire but too much good signal for a rejection: they downlevel – when you want to reduce the probability of a false positives for L5… offer L4!\n\nEngineers who are downleveled at Google accept the lower level offer a lot of the time, especially in the current climate. In some extreme cases, we’ve seen engineering managers with 10+ YoE accept an L3 (basically a new grad) offer.\n\nOnce you get past the hiring committee, you will move on to team matching. The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. In the ideal case, your recruiter will propose a few teams that are actively looking for someone with your skills, and then you’ll meet with the hiring manager from each team to gauge cultural fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.\n\nThat said, there are rare instances where a candidate will get past the hiring committee but then not find a team that they gel with.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Google Interviewer\n\n“Getting five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’ is most likely to result in a ‘No Hire’ decision. I have seen many cases where the candidates got five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’, and the recruiter gave them positive feedback too, but the candidate got rejected. In these cases, every person the candidate dealt with directly (the interviewers) were positive, yet the hiring committee (the only people in the process who dealt with the candidate indirectly) rejected the candidate.”\n\n## Google coding interview preparation resources\n\nHere are some tips for preparing for your Google coding interview:\n\n*   Practice in teams; have someone make up a question. Then have them disguise it or plant a red herring in it (for example, purposefully have it look like Three Sum, but it isn’t Three Sum).\n*   Practice with someone who can change the parameters after you’ve solved the main question by saying things like “Remember that assumption X we made earlier. What would happen if we removed that assumption?”\n*   If you see a question online that has been marked as “Asked in a Google interview”, then it is not going to be asked in your interview, period. Google is very good at retiring questions that have been leaked.\n*   Practice without the aid of an editor or IDE: in a Google doc, on a whiteboard, or with pen and paper.\n\nIn addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Google content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Google interviewers, long-form solutions to common Google questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Google interviews.\n\n### Google interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Google interviewers on our platform.

Meta’s interview process and questions\n    \n\nBefore you interview with Meta, [read our guide on negotiating with them](/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta). They’ve gotten very aggressive, and if you don’t know the rules, you will fail.\n\n## Meta’s interview process and questions\n\nMeta’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Call with a Meta recruiter\n*   Technical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)\n*   Onsite interviews\n\n![Meta’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fmeta-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Meta’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nMeta interviewers are guided by the company’s current motto: move fast. All human groups have a metaphor they operate from. Meta isn’t a family or an army. They’re a well-structured Formula 1 team; they spend a lot of effort to put safeguards in place, and then they go pedal to the metal. At Meta, speed wins.\n\nAt Meta, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently like you can at some other tech companies. You get one shot on goal every ~3 to 6 months, depending on performance.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“If you pass Meta’s onsite, but don’t take the offer your status of ‘passed onsite’ is valid for a year. If you don’t take their offer and then choose to re-engage within that year, tell their recruiter ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get steps skipped because you usually can.”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nWhen interviewing at Meta, listen closely to the subtle clues and hints your interviewer gives you. Meta is the only FAANG where you can’t become an interviewer unless you give good hints.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the previous section called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls). Also [read our guide to negotiating with Meta](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta). It starts at the recruiter call.\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nMeta's technical phone screen is a 45-minute coding interview that focuses on data structures and algorithms.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview, your interviewer will ask you a question or two about your resume and recent work that you've done. This portion will take 5 minutes, and how you answer these questions doesn't meaningfully factor into the interview's outcome - they are just meant to break the ice and get you talking. The part that matters is the technical portion.\n\nAfter the intro portion, your interviewer will ask you two coding questions, and they expect you to get through both in 35 minutes. These questions will be LeetCode easy or medium difficulty.\n\nMeta’s technical phone screens are conducted in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/). If you've never used it, you may want to [play around in their sandbox](https://app.coderpad.io/sandbox?_ga=2.197732077.314108963.1684799836-1650489622.1682112501&_gl=1*ijwnf5*_ga*MTY1MDQ4OTYyMi4xNjgyMTEyNTAx*_ga_XBQ5N5CE2N*MTY4NDc5OTgzNi40LjEuMTY4NDgwMDAzMi4xNC4wLjA.) and get familiar with their environment before your real interview. One specific thing about Meta's way of using CoderPad is that during the interview, they'll have code execution turned off - if you've used it before and are accustomed to testing your code during the interview by running it, you'll need to practice not being able to.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite interviews\n\nThe typical Meta onsite will consist of the following:\n\n*   At least two coding interviews\n*   Two system design OR product design interviews\n*   One behavioral interview\n\n#### Alternate Process for E6 engineers\n\nThe process for E6 engineers, as outlined in the diagram above, is slightly different. There will be a Leadership Assessment interview after the Technical Screen. In this interview, the following topics might be covered:\n\n*   Your current role, responsibility, and scope\n*   Cross-functional partnerships\n*   Situations regarding conflict resolution\n*   Solution skills\n*   How to drive results\n\nThe onsite for E6 engineers will also be different. You should only get one coding round, one architecture round, one design round and then a behavioral round.\n\n## Types of Meta interviews and what to expect\n\nThere are four main types of interviews you’re going to encounter when you apply for an engineering job at Meta – coding interviews, behavioral interviews, and either a system design or product design interview. Here’s what to expect during each of these rounds of interviews.\n\n### Coding interview\n\nMeta's process is highly standardized, so coding interview questions and themes tend to repeat. Coding questions are pre-approved, but that doesn’t mean the interviewers have no freedom.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Meta gives you the questions to ask or modify. But they don't tell you the answers in their interviewing wiki. And they let you design the path of the question: you get to ask your own twists and turns.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“There’s some variance with the interviewer, but usually there are 20 mins per question, and the questions are simple. They want you to get the algorithm fast, and implement the basic solution. The kind of bugs that can be acceptable are empty input, and out of scope inputs like empty array/null. But an incomplete algorithm at Meta usually doesn’t cut it. They want you to get to it and get to it quickly, and you can sacrifice making a little bit of a mess along the way.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“I think there is a rule that during the programming interview, interviewers have to ask two questions. And the questions have to be balanced. The first is more like a juicy question testing problem solving skills and you as the interviewer can permit some bugs in the implementation. The second will be easy from the algorithmic point of view but the goal is to assess how much the candidate can write debugless code and test this code perfectly. And if a candidate fails to solve both problems, even if they somewhat shine during one problem: it will be ‘No Hire’.”\n\nIt's not that bugs are encouraged, it’s that they're the only company that's top-down directive is: sometimes, in certain rounds, bugs are okay. No other company does that. Meta relaxes the need for bug-free code so that candidates can code faster.\n\nFinally, Meta doesn’t ask dynamic programming questions and, in fact, those questions are banned.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Meta’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Meta coding interview preparation resources](#facebook-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design OR product design interview\n\nMeta hires two types (on paper) of backend engineers: System Generalists and Product Generalists. System generalists get a system design interview, and product generalists get the confusingly named product design interview (in most other contexts, product design refers to UI/UX).\n\nWhich of these interviews you get is determined by your recruiter, based on your experience. If you have worked on a lot of product features, then you get a product design interview. If you have worked on high-scale distributed systems, then you get system design.\n\nThe product design interview at Meta is similar to the system design interview but with some key differences:\n\n*   System design focuses more on high level architecture and scale, while product design focuses more on interactions between services. For example, the expectations for API design in system design interviews is just high level arguments/data passed, whereas product design focuses more on the details, i.e., a more comprehensive list of arguments and response structure.\n*   Product design focuses more on how and what data flows through the entire system, between each service.\n*   Data models are weighted much higher in the product design interview than in system design. The expectation is to be more thorough and detailed.\n\nTake a look at this video, by Meta, about the difference between these two interview types:\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Product design is less databases, more data flow, more time spent on details of the API (e.g. parameters that will pass). System design is more databases, less API details, and more about scaling.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Many people think Meta only asks high level system design questions like ‘Design Twitter’ or ‘Design Meta Feed.’ But that’s not the case. They also ask low level questions. In E6 or above interviews, you will most likely be asked ‘Design Redis’, or ‘Design Kafka’, or ‘Design Memcached.’ I’d even seen rare occasions where E5 candidates would be asked low-level system design questions; low-level questions are less common in rounds for E5 and below.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“You have to ask about back of the envelope estimations. A lot of senior engineers hate to do that. I hate to do that as well. It’s a waste of time. When I do the ‘There is a rule that I have to do this. But there is no point in doing this. Let’s spend 5 minutes talking about real system design. Let’s assume we have to scale our system from 0 to Google level and therefore estimations are just a waste of time.’”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nAsk your interviewer: “Do you want to spend a few minutes on estimations? I’m okay with skipping it, but if you need to see it, then let’s do it. If we skipped it, one thing that might be a more interesting conversation would be spending a few minutes on how to scale this system.’”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you don’t know what to talk about in a E5 Meta system design round, talk about user experience. Go on about two choices you could make, then explain in depth the one preferred because it’d be a better user experience.\n\nIt’s also common for Meta interviewers to ask you to walk them through a system you’ve worked on in the past, which is known as a reverse system design interview.\n\n### Behavioral interview\n\nUnlike technical questions, behavioral questions at Meta are not standardized: interviewers can ask you whatever they want. Behavioral rounds are of medium/low importance at Meta; they’re less important than technical interview rounds, but they do carry some weight. For the best summary of what to expect in a Meta behavioral interview, read this [blog post by a former Meta engineering manager](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-software-engineering-behavioral-interviews-are-evaluated-meta) – in it he describes _exactly_ how behavioral interviews at Meta are evaluated and also includes a bunch of sample questions.\n\nHere is a list of questions to get you started. Read the post to get examples of good answers (split out by the candidate’s seniority level!)\n\n*   “What project are you most proud of and why?”\n*   “Tell me about a recent day working that was really great and/or fun.”\n*   “Tell me about a time when you wanted to change something that was outside of your regular scope of work.”\n*   “Tell me about a time you had to make a fast decision and live with the results.”\n*   “Tell me about a time when you needed to overcome external obstacles to complete a task or project.”\n*   “Tell me about a time a project took longer as expected.”\n*   “Tell me about a person or team who you found most challenging to work with.”\n*   “Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker.”\n*   “Tell me about a situation where two teams couldn’t agree on a path forward.”\n*   “Describe a situation when you made a mistake, and what you learned from it.”\n*   “Tell me about some constructive feedback you received from a manager or a peer”\n*   “Tell me about a skill set that you observed in a peer or mentor that you want to develop in the next six months.”\n\nFinally, if you are applying for E5 and above make sure to have a couple of projects that lasted longer than one quarter – if all your examples are of smaller initiatives, your interviewer may walk away with the impression that you can’t handle complex projects. Also, remember to quantify the impact that you made by sharing specific metrics.\n\n## How Meta makes hiring decisions\n\nMeta’s candidate review and feedback process is usually completely asynchronous. Sometimes, they’ll do a live debrief but it’s rare. This means there’s a low likelihood for an interviewer to “fight” for a candidate. Socially influencing interviewers won’t go very far here.\n\nMeta is also the only FAANG that asks interviewers for a confidence score when filling out post-onsite feedback forms. As a result, the process at Meta can be more forgiving on failed rounds because a lower confidence score means a failed round carries less weight. Also, Meta is the only FAANG that directly asks interviewers about downleveling.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Coding is used to decide ‘Should we hire this person?’ System and product design is used to decide ‘How should we level this person?’\n\nFor coding interviews, the interviewer says a binary score first: ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’. Then in the comments, they say how confident they are in that binary score. The ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ is an official metric, but the confidence score is not.\n\nFor system/product design, the interviewer gives the ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ first. Then they say if the candidate should be considered for another level.\n\nSo the final decision could be like: ‘No Hire’ for E5 with low confidence. ‘Hire’ for E4 with high confidence.\"\n\nIn cases where the hiring panel is hung, it’s possible they may request one more follow-up interview to help them get more signal.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Interview feedback is discussed primarily by the system design and behavioral interviewers, and those are the interviewers who have the most say regarding both the hire decision and a candidate’s level. If interviewers don’t feel like they got enough signal and the candidate ends up being on the fence, the recruiter will push for an additional round. Indicative hint: If you have an additional follow-up interview, your interviewers were probably split.\"\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“At Staff level and above, it’s a mandate that candidates can’t get hired if they don’t pass both system design rounds.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“For E6 and above candidates, if you fail one system design round but do well in the other rounds, you can get a mulligan. They can let you retake one system design round. But the same isn’t true for behavioral: if you fail there’s no mulligan. If you fail the behavioral round, it will be ‘No Hire.’”\n\n## 'Team matching, offers, and “Bootcamp”'\n\nMeta made some changes to their process in 2023. Before, unlike at other FAANGs, you'd generally accept an offer before knowing with which team you'd end up on. Then you'd do a 6 week “Bootcamp”, where you'd be trained on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems. After the bootcamp, there would be a 2 week team-matching period.\n\nNow, after you finish the onsite, you jump straight to the team matching process. Team matching now happens BEFORE you get an offer, and offers are contingent on team matching completely successfully.\n\nYou'll talk with hiring managers from a number of teams to gauge fit and chemistry: we've heard that sometimes it's a handful, and sometimes it's over 10.\n\nAfter your team matching conversations, your recruiter will ask you to choose a team. In order to move forward, both you and the hiring manager have to opt in.\n\nOnce you make your choice, your recruiter will officially make an offer, and you'll usually have just a few days to make your decision. We hope this will change in the future, but recently Meta has been very aggressive with both offer timelines and with negotiations - they will not negotiate unless you can share competitive offer details from another top-tier company.\n\nOne other key difference between Meta's new process and the old one is what happens during Bootcamp. Historically, Bootcamp took 6 weeks, and in addition to training new hires on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems, there'd be a multi-week “speed dating”-esque team matching component.\n\nBootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter - 2-4 weeks, and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers will continue to ramp up on their specific teams.\n\nThe team matching process is a bit like speed dating. You meet with hiring managers to gauge fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“When the market is good, you can talk to 20 different teams at the same time.”\n\nThere are exceptions – some people with niche skills may get hired for a specific team before they start Bootcamp, but they still have to do the bootcamp period, just not the team-matching part afterwards.\n\n## Meta coding interview preparation resources\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Meta content for you!

Meta’s interview process and questions\n    \n\nBefore you interview with Meta, [read our guide on negotiating with them](/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta). They’ve gotten very aggressive, and if you don’t know the rules, you will fail.\n\n## Meta’s interview process and questions\n\nMeta’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Call with a Meta recruiter\n*   Technical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)\n*   Onsite interviews\n\n![Meta’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fmeta-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Meta’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nMeta interviewers are guided by the company’s current motto: move fast. All human groups have a metaphor they operate from. Meta isn’t a family or an army. They’re a well-structured Formula 1 team; they spend a lot of effort to put safeguards in place, and then they go pedal to the metal. At Meta, speed wins.\n\nAt Meta, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently like you can at some other tech companies. You get one shot on goal every ~3 to 6 months, depending on performance.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“If you pass Meta’s onsite, but don’t take the offer your status of ‘passed onsite’ is valid for a year. If you don’t take their offer and then choose to re-engage within that year, tell their recruiter ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get steps skipped because you usually can.”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nWhen interviewing at Meta, listen closely to the subtle clues and hints your interviewer gives you. Meta is the only FAANG where you can’t become an interviewer unless you give good hints.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the previous section called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls). Also [read our guide to negotiating with Meta](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta). It starts at the recruiter call.\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nMeta's technical phone screen is a 45-minute coding interview that focuses on data structures and algorithms.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview, your interviewer will ask you a question or two about your resume and recent work that you've done. This portion will take 5 minutes, and how you answer these questions doesn't meaningfully factor into the interview's outcome - they are just meant to break the ice and get you talking. The part that matters is the technical portion.\n\nAfter the intro portion, your interviewer will ask you two coding questions, and they expect you to get through both in 35 minutes. These questions will be LeetCode easy or medium difficulty.\n\nMeta’s technical phone screens are conducted in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/). If you've never used it, you may want to [play around in their sandbox](https://app.coderpad.io/sandbox?_ga=2.197732077.314108963.1684799836-1650489622.1682112501&_gl=1*ijwnf5*_ga*MTY1MDQ4OTYyMi4xNjgyMTEyNTAx*_ga_XBQ5N5CE2N*MTY4NDc5OTgzNi40LjEuMTY4NDgwMDAzMi4xNC4wLjA.) and get familiar with their environment before your real interview. One specific thing about Meta's way of using CoderPad is that during the interview, they'll have code execution turned off - if you've used it before and are accustomed to testing your code during the interview by running it, you'll need to practice not being able to.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite interviews\n\nThe typical Meta onsite will consist of the following:\n\n*   At least two coding interviews\n*   Two system design OR product design interviews\n*   One behavioral interview\n\n#### Alternate Process for E6 engineers\n\nThe process for E6 engineers, as outlined in the diagram above, is slightly different. There will be a Leadership Assessment interview after the Technical Screen. In this interview, the following topics might be covered:\n\n*   Your current role, responsibility, and scope\n*   Cross-functional partnerships\n*   Situations regarding conflict resolution\n*   Solution skills\n*   How to drive results\n\nThe onsite for E6 engineers will also be different. You should only get one coding round, one architecture round, one design round and then a behavioral round.\n\n## Types of Meta interviews and what to expect\n\nThere are four main types of interviews you’re going to encounter when you apply for an engineering job at Meta – coding interviews, behavioral interviews, and either a system design or product design interview. Here’s what to expect during each of these rounds of interviews.\n\n### Coding interview\n\nMeta's process is highly standardized, so coding interview questions and themes tend to repeat. Coding questions are pre-approved, but that doesn’t mean the interviewers have no freedom.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Meta gives you the questions to ask or modify. But they don't tell you the answers in their interviewing wiki. And they let you design the path of the question: you get to ask your own twists and turns.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“There’s some variance with the interviewer, but usually there are 20 mins per question, and the questions are simple. They want you to get the algorithm fast, and implement the basic solution. The kind of bugs that can be acceptable are empty input, and out of scope inputs like empty array/null. But an incomplete algorithm at Meta usually doesn’t cut it. They want you to get to it and get to it quickly, and you can sacrifice making a little bit of a mess along the way.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“I think there is a rule that during the programming interview, interviewers have to ask two questions. And the questions have to be balanced. The first is more like a juicy question testing problem solving skills and you as the interviewer can permit some bugs in the implementation. The second will be easy from the algorithmic point of view but the goal is to assess how much the candidate can write debugless code and test this code perfectly. And if a candidate fails to solve both problems, even if they somewhat shine during one problem: it will be ‘No Hire’.”\n\nIt's not that bugs are encouraged, it’s that they're the only company that's top-down directive is: sometimes, in certain rounds, bugs are okay. No other company does that. Meta relaxes the need for bug-free code so that candidates can code faster.\n\nFinally, Meta doesn’t ask dynamic programming questions and, in fact, those questions are banned.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Meta’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Meta coding interview preparation resources](#facebook-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design OR product design interview\n\nMeta hires two types (on paper) of backend engineers: System Generalists and Product Generalists. System generalists get a system design interview, and product generalists get the confusingly named product design interview (in most other contexts, product design refers to UI/UX).\n\nWhich of these interviews you get is determined by your recruiter, based on your experience. If you have worked on a lot of product features, then you get a product design interview. If you have worked on high-scale distributed systems, then you get system design.\n\nThe product design interview at Meta is similar to the system design interview but with some key differences:\n\n*   System design focuses more on high level architecture and scale, while product design focuses more on interactions between services. For example, the expectations for API design in system design interviews is just high level arguments/data passed, whereas product design focuses more on the details, i.e., a more comprehensive list of arguments and response structure.\n*   Product design focuses more on how and what data flows through the entire system, between each service.\n*   Data models are weighted much higher in the product design interview than in system design. The expectation is to be more thorough and detailed.\n\nTake a look at this video, by Meta, about the difference between these two interview types:\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Product design is less databases, more data flow, more time spent on details of the API (e.g. parameters that will pass). System design is more databases, less API details, and more about scaling.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Many people think Meta only asks high level system design questions like ‘Design Twitter’ or ‘Design Meta Feed.’ But that’s not the case. They also ask low level questions. In E6 or above interviews, you will most likely be asked ‘Design Redis’, or ‘Design Kafka’, or ‘Design Memcached.’ I’d even seen rare occasions where E5 candidates would be asked low-level system design questions; low-level questions are less common in rounds for E5 and below.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“You have to ask about back of the envelope estimations. A lot of senior engineers hate to do that. I hate to do that as well. It’s a waste of time. When I do the ‘There is a rule that I have to do this. But there is no point in doing this. Let’s spend 5 minutes talking about real system design. Let’s assume we have to scale our system from 0 to Google level and therefore estimations are just a waste of time.’”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nAsk your interviewer: “Do you want to spend a few minutes on estimations? I’m okay with skipping it, but if you need to see it, then let’s do it. If we skipped it, one thing that might be a more interesting conversation would be spending a few minutes on how to scale this system.’”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you don’t know what to talk about in a E5 Meta system design round, talk about user experience. Go on about two choices you could make, then explain in depth the one preferred because it’d be a better user experience.\n\nIt’s also common for Meta interviewers to ask you to walk them through a system you’ve worked on in the past, which is known as a reverse system design interview.\n\n### Behavioral interview\n\nUnlike technical questions, behavioral questions at Meta are not standardized: interviewers can ask you whatever they want. Behavioral rounds are of medium/low importance at Meta; they’re less important than technical interview rounds, but they do carry some weight. For the best summary of what to expect in a Meta behavioral interview, read this [blog post by a former Meta engineering manager](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-software-engineering-behavioral-interviews-are-evaluated-meta) – in it he describes _exactly_ how behavioral interviews at Meta are evaluated and also includes a bunch of sample questions.\n\nHere is a list of questions to get you started. Read the post to get examples of good answers (split out by the candidate’s seniority level!)\n\n*   “What project are you most proud of and why?”\n*   “Tell me about a recent day working that was really great and/or fun.”\n*   “Tell me about a time when you wanted to change something that was outside of your regular scope of work.”\n*   “Tell me about a time you had to make a fast decision and live with the results.”\n*   “Tell me about a time when you needed to overcome external obstacles to complete a task or project.”\n*   “Tell me about a time a project took longer as expected.”\n*   “Tell me about a person or team who you found most challenging to work with.”\n*   “Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker.”\n*   “Tell me about a situation where two teams couldn’t agree on a path forward.”\n*   “Describe a situation when you made a mistake, and what you learned from it.”\n*   “Tell me about some constructive feedback you received from a manager or a peer”\n*   “Tell me about a skill set that you observed in a peer or mentor that you want to develop in the next six months.”\n\nFinally, if you are applying for E5 and above make sure to have a couple of projects that lasted longer than one quarter – if all your examples are of smaller initiatives, your interviewer may walk away with the impression that you can’t handle complex projects. Also, remember to quantify the impact that you made by sharing specific metrics.\n\n## How Meta makes hiring decisions\n\nMeta’s candidate review and feedback process is usually completely asynchronous. Sometimes, they’ll do a live debrief but it’s rare. This means there’s a low likelihood for an interviewer to “fight” for a candidate. Socially influencing interviewers won’t go very far here.\n\nMeta is also the only FAANG that asks interviewers for a confidence score when filling out post-onsite feedback forms. As a result, the process at Meta can be more forgiving on failed rounds because a lower confidence score means a failed round carries less weight. Also, Meta is the only FAANG that directly asks interviewers about downleveling.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Coding is used to decide ‘Should we hire this person?’ System and product design is used to decide ‘How should we level this person?’\n\nFor coding interviews, the interviewer says a binary score first: ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’. Then in the comments, they say how confident they are in that binary score. The ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ is an official metric, but the confidence score is not.\n\nFor system/product design, the interviewer gives the ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ first. Then they say if the candidate should be considered for another level.\n\nSo the final decision could be like: ‘No Hire’ for E5 with low confidence. ‘Hire’ for E4 with high confidence.\"\n\nIn cases where the hiring panel is hung, it’s possible they may request one more follow-up interview to help them get more signal.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Interview feedback is discussed primarily by the system design and behavioral interviewers, and those are the interviewers who have the most say regarding both the hire decision and a candidate’s level. If interviewers don’t feel like they got enough signal and the candidate ends up being on the fence, the recruiter will push for an additional round. Indicative hint: If you have an additional follow-up interview, your interviewers were probably split.\"\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“At Staff level and above, it’s a mandate that candidates can’t get hired if they don’t pass both system design rounds.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“For E6 and above candidates, if you fail one system design round but do well in the other rounds, you can get a mulligan. They can let you retake one system design round. But the same isn’t true for behavioral: if you fail there’s no mulligan. If you fail the behavioral round, it will be ‘No Hire.’”\n\n## 'Team matching, offers, and “Bootcamp”'\n\nMeta made some changes to their process in 2023. Before, unlike at other FAANGs, you'd generally accept an offer before knowing with which team you'd end up on. Then you'd do a 6 week “Bootcamp”, where you'd be trained on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems. After the bootcamp, there would be a 2 week team-matching period.\n\nNow, after you finish the onsite, you jump straight to the team matching process. Team matching now happens BEFORE you get an offer, and offers are contingent on team matching completely successfully.\n\nYou'll talk with hiring managers from a number of teams to gauge fit and chemistry: we've heard that sometimes it's a handful, and sometimes it's over 10.\n\nAfter your team matching conversations, your recruiter will ask you to choose a team. In order to move forward, both you and the hiring manager have to opt in.\n\nOnce you make your choice, your recruiter will officially make an offer, and you'll usually have just a few days to make your decision. We hope this will change in the future, but recently Meta has been very aggressive with both offer timelines and with negotiations - they will not negotiate unless you can share competitive offer details from another top-tier company.\n\nOne other key difference between Meta's new process and the old one is what happens during Bootcamp. Historically, Bootcamp took 6 weeks, and in addition to training new hires on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems, there'd be a multi-week “speed dating”-esque team matching component.\n\nBootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter - 2-4 weeks, and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers will continue to ramp up on their specific teams.\n\nThe team matching process is a bit like speed dating. You meet with hiring managers to gauge fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“When the market is good, you can talk to 20 different teams at the same time.”\n\nThere are exceptions – some people with niche skills may get hired for a specific team before they start Bootcamp, but they still have to do the bootcamp period, just not the team-matching part afterwards.\n\n## Meta coding interview preparation resources\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Meta content for you!

Meta’s interview process and questions\n    \n\nBefore you interview with Meta, [read our guide on negotiating with them](/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta). They’ve gotten very aggressive, and if you don’t know the rules, you will fail.\n\n## Meta’s interview process and questions\n\nMeta’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Call with a Meta recruiter\n*   Technical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)\n*   Onsite interviews\n\n![Meta’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fmeta-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Meta’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nMeta interviewers are guided by the company’s current motto: move fast. All human groups have a metaphor they operate from. Meta isn’t a family or an army. They’re a well-structured Formula 1 team; they spend a lot of effort to put safeguards in place, and then they go pedal to the metal. At Meta, speed wins.\n\nAt Meta, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently like you can at some other tech companies. You get one shot on goal every ~3 to 6 months, depending on performance.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“If you pass Meta’s onsite, but don’t take the offer your status of ‘passed onsite’ is valid for a year. If you don’t take their offer and then choose to re-engage within that year, tell their recruiter ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get steps skipped because you usually can.”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nWhen interviewing at Meta, listen closely to the subtle clues and hints your interviewer gives you. Meta is the only FAANG where you can’t become an interviewer unless you give good hints.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the previous section called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls). Also [read our guide to negotiating with Meta](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-meta). It starts at the recruiter call.\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nMeta's technical phone screen is a 45-minute coding interview that focuses on data structures and algorithms.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview, your interviewer will ask you a question or two about your resume and recent work that you've done. This portion will take 5 minutes, and how you answer these questions doesn't meaningfully factor into the interview's outcome - they are just meant to break the ice and get you talking. The part that matters is the technical portion.\n\nAfter the intro portion, your interviewer will ask you two coding questions, and they expect you to get through both in 35 minutes. These questions will be LeetCode easy or medium difficulty.\n\nMeta’s technical phone screens are conducted in [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/). If you've never used it, you may want to [play around in their sandbox](https://app.coderpad.io/sandbox?_ga=2.197732077.314108963.1684799836-1650489622.1682112501&_gl=1*ijwnf5*_ga*MTY1MDQ4OTYyMi4xNjgyMTEyNTAx*_ga_XBQ5N5CE2N*MTY4NDc5OTgzNi40LjEuMTY4NDgwMDAzMi4xNC4wLjA.) and get familiar with their environment before your real interview. One specific thing about Meta's way of using CoderPad is that during the interview, they'll have code execution turned off - if you've used it before and are accustomed to testing your code during the interview by running it, you'll need to practice not being able to.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite interviews\n\nThe typical Meta onsite will consist of the following:\n\n*   At least two coding interviews\n*   Two system design OR product design interviews\n*   One behavioral interview\n\n#### Alternate Process for E6 engineers\n\nThe process for E6 engineers, as outlined in the diagram above, is slightly different. There will be a Leadership Assessment interview after the Technical Screen. In this interview, the following topics might be covered:\n\n*   Your current role, responsibility, and scope\n*   Cross-functional partnerships\n*   Situations regarding conflict resolution\n*   Solution skills\n*   How to drive results\n\nThe onsite for E6 engineers will also be different. You should only get one coding round, one architecture round, one design round and then a behavioral round.\n\n## Types of Meta interviews and what to expect\n\nThere are four main types of interviews you’re going to encounter when you apply for an engineering job at Meta – coding interviews, behavioral interviews, and either a system design or product design interview. Here’s what to expect during each of these rounds of interviews.\n\n### Coding interview\n\nMeta's process is highly standardized, so coding interview questions and themes tend to repeat. Coding questions are pre-approved, but that doesn’t mean the interviewers have no freedom.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Meta gives you the questions to ask or modify. But they don't tell you the answers in their interviewing wiki. And they let you design the path of the question: you get to ask your own twists and turns.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“There’s some variance with the interviewer, but usually there are 20 mins per question, and the questions are simple. They want you to get the algorithm fast, and implement the basic solution. The kind of bugs that can be acceptable are empty input, and out of scope inputs like empty array/null. But an incomplete algorithm at Meta usually doesn’t cut it. They want you to get to it and get to it quickly, and you can sacrifice making a little bit of a mess along the way.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“I think there is a rule that during the programming interview, interviewers have to ask two questions. And the questions have to be balanced. The first is more like a juicy question testing problem solving skills and you as the interviewer can permit some bugs in the implementation. The second will be easy from the algorithmic point of view but the goal is to assess how much the candidate can write debugless code and test this code perfectly. And if a candidate fails to solve both problems, even if they somewhat shine during one problem: it will be ‘No Hire’.”\n\nIt's not that bugs are encouraged, it’s that they're the only company that's top-down directive is: sometimes, in certain rounds, bugs are okay. No other company does that. Meta relaxes the need for bug-free code so that candidates can code faster.\n\nFinally, Meta doesn’t ask dynamic programming questions and, in fact, those questions are banned.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Meta’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Meta coding interview preparation resources](#facebook-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design OR product design interview\n\nMeta hires two types (on paper) of backend engineers: System Generalists and Product Generalists. System generalists get a system design interview, and product generalists get the confusingly named product design interview (in most other contexts, product design refers to UI/UX).\n\nWhich of these interviews you get is determined by your recruiter, based on your experience. If you have worked on a lot of product features, then you get a product design interview. If you have worked on high-scale distributed systems, then you get system design.\n\nThe product design interview at Meta is similar to the system design interview but with some key differences:\n\n*   System design focuses more on high level architecture and scale, while product design focuses more on interactions between services. For example, the expectations for API design in system design interviews is just high level arguments/data passed, whereas product design focuses more on the details, i.e., a more comprehensive list of arguments and response structure.\n*   Product design focuses more on how and what data flows through the entire system, between each service.\n*   Data models are weighted much higher in the product design interview than in system design. The expectation is to be more thorough and detailed.\n\nTake a look at this video, by Meta, about the difference between these two interview types:\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Product design is less databases, more data flow, more time spent on details of the API (e.g. parameters that will pass). System design is more databases, less API details, and more about scaling.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Many people think Meta only asks high level system design questions like ‘Design Twitter’ or ‘Design Meta Feed.’ But that’s not the case. They also ask low level questions. In E6 or above interviews, you will most likely be asked ‘Design Redis’, or ‘Design Kafka’, or ‘Design Memcached.’ I’d even seen rare occasions where E5 candidates would be asked low-level system design questions; low-level questions are less common in rounds for E5 and below.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“You have to ask about back of the envelope estimations. A lot of senior engineers hate to do that. I hate to do that as well. It’s a waste of time. When I do the ‘There is a rule that I have to do this. But there is no point in doing this. Let’s spend 5 minutes talking about real system design. Let’s assume we have to scale our system from 0 to Google level and therefore estimations are just a waste of time.’”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nAsk your interviewer: “Do you want to spend a few minutes on estimations? I’m okay with skipping it, but if you need to see it, then let’s do it. If we skipped it, one thing that might be a more interesting conversation would be spending a few minutes on how to scale this system.’”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you don’t know what to talk about in a E5 Meta system design round, talk about user experience. Go on about two choices you could make, then explain in depth the one preferred because it’d be a better user experience.\n\nIt’s also common for Meta interviewers to ask you to walk them through a system you’ve worked on in the past, which is known as a reverse system design interview.\n\n### Behavioral interview\n\nUnlike technical questions, behavioral questions at Meta are not standardized: interviewers can ask you whatever they want. Behavioral rounds are of medium/low importance at Meta; they’re less important than technical interview rounds, but they do carry some weight. For the best summary of what to expect in a Meta behavioral interview, read this [blog post by a former Meta engineering manager](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-software-engineering-behavioral-interviews-are-evaluated-meta) – in it he describes _exactly_ how behavioral interviews at Meta are evaluated and also includes a bunch of sample questions.\n\nHere is a list of questions to get you started. Read the post to get examples of good answers (split out by the candidate’s seniority level!)\n\n*   “What project are you most proud of and why?”\n*   “Tell me about a recent day working that was really great and/or fun.”\n*   “Tell me about a time when you wanted to change something that was outside of your regular scope of work.”\n*   “Tell me about a time you had to make a fast decision and live with the results.”\n*   “Tell me about a time when you needed to overcome external obstacles to complete a task or project.”\n*   “Tell me about a time a project took longer as expected.”\n*   “Tell me about a person or team who you found most challenging to work with.”\n*   “Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker.”\n*   “Tell me about a situation where two teams couldn’t agree on a path forward.”\n*   “Describe a situation when you made a mistake, and what you learned from it.”\n*   “Tell me about some constructive feedback you received from a manager or a peer”\n*   “Tell me about a skill set that you observed in a peer or mentor that you want to develop in the next six months.”\n\nFinally, if you are applying for E5 and above make sure to have a couple of projects that lasted longer than one quarter – if all your examples are of smaller initiatives, your interviewer may walk away with the impression that you can’t handle complex projects. Also, remember to quantify the impact that you made by sharing specific metrics.\n\n## How Meta makes hiring decisions\n\nMeta’s candidate review and feedback process is usually completely asynchronous. Sometimes, they’ll do a live debrief but it’s rare. This means there’s a low likelihood for an interviewer to “fight” for a candidate. Socially influencing interviewers won’t go very far here.\n\nMeta is also the only FAANG that asks interviewers for a confidence score when filling out post-onsite feedback forms. As a result, the process at Meta can be more forgiving on failed rounds because a lower confidence score means a failed round carries less weight. Also, Meta is the only FAANG that directly asks interviewers about downleveling.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Coding is used to decide ‘Should we hire this person?’ System and product design is used to decide ‘How should we level this person?’\n\nFor coding interviews, the interviewer says a binary score first: ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’. Then in the comments, they say how confident they are in that binary score. The ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ is an official metric, but the confidence score is not.\n\nFor system/product design, the interviewer gives the ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ first. Then they say if the candidate should be considered for another level.\n\nSo the final decision could be like: ‘No Hire’ for E5 with low confidence. ‘Hire’ for E4 with high confidence.\"\n\nIn cases where the hiring panel is hung, it’s possible they may request one more follow-up interview to help them get more signal.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“Interview feedback is discussed primarily by the system design and behavioral interviewers, and those are the interviewers who have the most say regarding both the hire decision and a candidate’s level. If interviewers don’t feel like they got enough signal and the candidate ends up being on the fence, the recruiter will push for an additional round. Indicative hint: If you have an additional follow-up interview, your interviewers were probably split.\"\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“At Staff level and above, it’s a mandate that candidates can’t get hired if they don’t pass both system design rounds.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“For E6 and above candidates, if you fail one system design round but do well in the other rounds, you can get a mulligan. They can let you retake one system design round. But the same isn’t true for behavioral: if you fail there’s no mulligan. If you fail the behavioral round, it will be ‘No Hire.’”\n\n## 'Team matching, offers, and “Bootcamp”'\n\nMeta made some changes to their process in 2023. Before, unlike at other FAANGs, you'd generally accept an offer before knowing with which team you'd end up on. Then you'd do a 6 week “Bootcamp”, where you'd be trained on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems. After the bootcamp, there would be a 2 week team-matching period.\n\nNow, after you finish the onsite, you jump straight to the team matching process. Team matching now happens BEFORE you get an offer, and offers are contingent on team matching completely successfully.\n\nYou'll talk with hiring managers from a number of teams to gauge fit and chemistry: we've heard that sometimes it's a handful, and sometimes it's over 10.\n\nAfter your team matching conversations, your recruiter will ask you to choose a team. In order to move forward, both you and the hiring manager have to opt in.\n\nOnce you make your choice, your recruiter will officially make an offer, and you'll usually have just a few days to make your decision. We hope this will change in the future, but recently Meta has been very aggressive with both offer timelines and with negotiations - they will not negotiate unless you can share competitive offer details from another top-tier company.\n\nOne other key difference between Meta's new process and the old one is what happens during Bootcamp. Historically, Bootcamp took 6 weeks, and in addition to training new hires on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems, there'd be a multi-week “speed dating”-esque team matching component.\n\nBootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter - 2-4 weeks, and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers will continue to ramp up on their specific teams.\n\nThe team matching process is a bit like speed dating. You meet with hiring managers to gauge fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer\n\n“When the market is good, you can talk to 20 different teams at the same time.”\n\nThere are exceptions – some people with niche skills may get hired for a specific team before they start Bootcamp, but they still have to do the bootcamp period, just not the team-matching part afterwards.\n\n## Meta coding interview preparation resources\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Meta content for you!

Amazon isn’t a sports team or a family; they’re a motley crew of Terminators. They’re a different breed with notoriously high standards. They reward aggression. And they want to take over the market (or the earth, depending on who you ask)...\n\nAmazon’s process is not centralized, and you can interview with multiple teams concurrently. To up your odds, interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.\n\nAmazon really loves their [Leadership Principles (LPs)](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles). Amazon interviewers may sandwich LP questions anywhere and everywhere throughout your interview rounds: coding rounds, system design rounds, all rounds. In short, at an Amazon interview, be prepared for Leadership Principles questions anywhere, anytime.\n\nFinally, Amazon has one of the more-structured interviewing cultures. They’re the only FAANG where interviewers exist in a formal hierarchy, and Amazon openly encourages and rewards interviewers who reach the top rung in that hierarchy.\n\nIn this guide we’ve compiled a comprehensive Amazon job interview prep guide based on in-depth discussions with Amazon interviewers and interviewees. Our guide includes a detailed walkthrough of the interview process, common questions and solutions, interview tips, video replays of mock Amazon interviews, and more.\n\n## An overview of Amazon's interview process and questions\n\nAmazon’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call OR online assessment\n*   Technical phone screen (if you didn’t do the online assessment)\n*   Onsite\n\nWe walk through each of these steps in detail below.\n\n![Amazon’s interview process: online assessment or recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Famazon-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Step 1: Online assessment or recruiter call\n\nWhether you start with an online assessment or an Amazon recruiter call depends on a few factors:\n\n*   Are you a mid-to-senior engineer?\n*   Have you previously interviewed at Amazon?\n*   Have you previously worked at a FAANG?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then you will likely not have to do an online assessment, and your first step will be a recruiter call. That said, we’ve gotten some conflicting reports from Amazonians, and it may be that Amazon has more recently started using online assessments to test the competencies of more senior engineers as well.\n\nIf you do the online assessment, here’s how it works. It’s a timed, asynchronous test consisting of several coding problems, conducted via [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). These are usually data structures and algorithm problems of easy to medium-level difficulty, as well as some multiple choice system design questions where you have to select the design option that’s ideal in a given situation. If you do well in the online assessment, you can skip the second step, which is the technical phone screen.\n\nIf you end up skipping the online assessment, the first step in your process will be a recruiter call. Please see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls.”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nAmazon’s technical phone interview is a coding interview that tends to focus exclusively on data structures and algorithms. Despite the focus on speed, [Amazon interview questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon) may require a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.\n\nFor these screens, Amazon uses an internal tool called Livecode, which has syntax highlighting for popular languages but does NOT have the ability to run the code. In fact, no code is ever compiled or run in Amazon technical interviews.\n\nFinally, there’s a 50% chance that your interviewer will throw in 1 or 2 Leadership Principles questions into the phone screen. They’re not guaranteed, but they’ll definitely come up during the onsite.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite interviews\n\nThere’s some variance, but the typical Amazon onsite, or in-person interview, for technical roles, will consist of:\n\n*   At least one behavioral round (this doesn’t include all the Leadership Principles questions peppered through the other interviews)\n*   Three coding rounds\n*   One system design round\n*   One hiring manager round\n\nAmazon has a special type of interviewer that they include in onsite loops: the Bar Raiser. These are typically senior-level Amazon employees at the top of the formal interviewer hierarchy, and they’re the toughest and most-trained interviewers at Amazon. They serve as an independent and objective evaluator, asking follow-up questions, and ensuring that hiring decisions are not influenced solely by the candidate's immediate team or department.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\n“Being a Bar Raiser makes an impact on your promotion packet. Every L5 nearing promotion at Amazon, is encouraged to do the Bar Raiser training. It’s a big input to get to L6 or L7. Part of the promotion packet is: how are you demonstrating some of the Leadership Principles. And “Hire and Develop the Best” is one of the LPs. There’s a lot of work to do in hiring to become a Bar Raiser: you have to do a lot of training and a ton of interviews. Being a Bar Raiser carries a lot of weight at Amazon if you want to get promoted.”\n\nAt Amazon, Bar Raisers and hiring managers are the only interviewers who have the formal authority to veto a hiring decision. You can recognize them because they are the only interviewer in your onsite loop who has nothing to do with the team you’re interviewing for. Bar Raiser rounds can be super intense, but don’t shrink when you feel a Bar Raiser throw flames your way; embrace the fire.\n\n## The three types of Amazon interview\n\nThere are three main types of interviews you’ll face as a software engineer interviewing at Amazon. These are coding, behavioral, and system design interviews.\n\n### 1\\. Coding interview\n\nYou will have to do coding interviews in the phone screen and in the onsite. Coding rounds at the onsite are very similar to technical phone screen rounds, except that in the technical phone screen you _might_ get Leadership Principles questions, whereas in the onsite coding portion, you definitely _will_.\n\nAmazon asks mostly medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions and avoids hard questions. The idea is to let candidates demonstrate how quickly they get to the optimal result, all in the service of hiring engineers who can churn out new features quickly.\n\nDespite the focus on speed, Amazon questions may be a complex problem that requires a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.\n\nAmazon’s coding rounds test the following technical skills:\n\n1.  Computer science fundamentals and knowledge of data structures and algorithms\n2.  The ability to write logical and maintainable code. These rounds require writing some classes and implementing some functions, e.g., “Implement some common functions of a file system”\n\nAlthough your performance in technical interviews matters (if you fail the technical, you usually will not move forward), it’s not as important as the outcome of the behavioral interview, and coding interviews during the onsite at Amazon actually feature Leadership Principles questions.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Amazon Interviewer\n\n“Because no code is ever run on an editor, the approach, speed, and testing are most important. Code syntax, typos, variable naming, and edge cases are less important.”\n\nGraph questions are among the most popular types of questions asked at Amazon, as well as tree questions that require BFS or DFS. Classic questions like LRU cache, meeting rooms, word break, word search, word ladder, and so on may also come up.\n\nWe’ve heard from Amazon interviewers that _all_ of the data structures and algorithms questions in Amazon’s official question bank are actually on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-amazon-questions/). That said, Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in coding rounds, and some will deviate from the question bank to ask more practical questions such as, “Implement a function with some behavior with the help of these two APIs…””\n\nFinally, like Facebook, Amazon shies away from dynamic programming questions (though they’re not banned outright).\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Amazon’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Amazon coding interview preparation resources](#amazon-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### 2\\. Behavioral interview\n\nThe behavioral interview is one of, along with coding interviews at the onsite, the most important in terms of leading to an offer.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\n“I’ve done over a hundred interviews at Amazon. The behavioral interview is most likely to get someone pushed over the line if they were borderline in their technical interviews. The opposite is not true: if they don’t meet the behavioral bar, we don’t care how they did in technicals, we aren’t hiring them.”\n\nBehavioral is an extremely important part of the Amazon interview process – Amazon is more likely to downlevel or reject you solely based on behavioral – and their behavioral round might be the most well-thought-out interview in all of big tech. It also might be the easiest to fail if you don’t specifically prepare for it. There’s no flavor like the flavor of an Amazonian behavioral interviewer; if you’ve never encountered it before and don’t expect it, it can be jarring.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes our users make is not taking this interview seriously because at most other companies, behavioral interviews tend to be more lip service than a meaningful part of the process. The bottom line is, if you want an Amazon job at a senior level or above, you have to seriously prepare for the behavioral interview questions.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nNot all Leadership Principles are created equal. Customer Obsession is the 👑one Leadership Principle to rule them all. When in doubt, demonstrate Customer Obsession. If you get a curveball, give an answer that shows you’re deeply committed to making things customers love.\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\n“If you have a bad LP round, or if LPs are problematic in the debrief, it’s almost always a ‘no hire.’ But if you have great LPs then there is a conversation where we try to see if the candidate can be hired even if the technical rounds weren't at the bar. But not the other way around. But if there’s anything ‘at the bar’ or ‘below the bar’ for LP, then you fail.”\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\n“If a candidate does not do that well on the technical round but they do well on LPs, there is always a possibility of recycling the candidate because they’re a good fit for Amazon but not good for the team. So sometimes we’ll help them interview with other teams, and they don’t have to do a full onsite: they just need to do 1-2 more rounds as a follow up. But if they’re below the bar for LPs, then they’re not a fit for Amazon so Amazon wouldn’t help set them up to other teams with shortened onsites.”\n\nIn this round, expect questions from all 5 of these categories:\n\n1.  Technical problem solving\n2.  Learning (and failure)\n3.  Getting stuff (for the business) done\n4.  Interpersonal conflict\n5.  Ambiguity\n\nHonestly, the best place to find a detailed question list for Amazon’s behavioral interview, as well as a bunch of other interview preparation resources, is our [Senior Engineer's Guide to the Amazon Leadership Principles Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles).\n\n### 3\\. System design interview\n\nSystem design and coding aren’t the be-all and end-all at Amazon – of course, you still have to pass them, but if your performance is borderline, doing well on behavioral Leadership Principles questions will take you over the finish line. In fact, interviewers will likely ask you 1-2 Leadership Principles questions in your system design interviews. Try to be efficient when answering LP questions in system design rounds. LPs come first. Finish them early so that you have more time for the technical question.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Amazon Interviewer\n\n“In many debriefs, I hear the hiring manager say that we can extend the L5 offer with the understanding that system design is not their strength, but it's coachable. At the L6 level, the system design bar is comparable to Facebook or Google.”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you’re in a system design round at Amazon, and you don’t know what to talk about, talk about performance. They want Amazon to be the number one customer of AWS. And they love to find engineers who understand and are passionate about fine tuning performance in the cloud.\n\nAmazon is more likely to ask you practical system design questions. For example, if you’re interviewing with a team who controls Amazon’s inventory management, they might ask you to design a piece of an inventory management system.\n\nOther common system design questions include:\n\n*   Design autocomplete\n*   Design file upload/download to the cloud\n*   Design search\n\nThe design questions are most likely about designing well-known features, as opposed to a complete system from scratch like Design Facebook or Twitter.\n\nAmazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in system design, but a lot of interviewers fall back on reusing questions from Amazon’s question bank.\n\nFor tooling in system design interviews, candidates can usually choose any type of drawing tool. [Excalidraw](https://app.excalidraw.com/) is most popular, followed by [Miro](https://miro.com/).\n\n## How Amazon makes hiring decisions\n\nAmazon has one of the more well-structured decision-making processes in tech: teams typically do a pre-brief (live meeting before the onsite), submit asynchronous feedback, and also do a debrief (live meeting after the onsite). They rely heavily on live discussion to make decisions. Notably, though some interviewers might be able to tell an outlier story of a time a regular interviewer out-argued a Bar Raiser, most of the time the interviewers go along with what the Bar Raiser says.\n\nAmazon interviewer’s grade on a 5-point scale: Strongly Inclined, Inclined, Neutral, Not Inclined, Strongly Not Inclined.\n\nThe two most important interviewers at the onsite are the Bar Raiser and the hiring manager. At Amazon, all of the other team members involved in the interview could vote to hire, but if the Bar Raiser _or_ the hiring manager aren’t on board, that candidate is likely getting rejected.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nAt Amazon, identify the Bar Raiser (the only person whose work has nothing to do with the team for which you’re interviewing) and the hiring manager (if you don’t know who it is, ask the recruiter before the onsite or an interviewer if during the onsite). Most of your energy should go towards impressing these two people – since Amazon relies so heavily on live discussions to make hiring decisions, impression management is more impactful here.\n\n## Resources to prepare yourself for an Amazon coding interview\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Amazon content for you!

[Learning Center](/learn)\n    \n2.  [Guides](/learn#interview-guides)\n    \n3.  Amazon's interview process and questions\n    \n\nAll human organizations operate as a metaphor. Amazon isn’t a sports team or a family; they’re a motley crew of Terminators. They’re a different breed with notoriously high standards. They reward aggression. And they want to take over the market (or the earth, depending on who you ask)...\n\nAmazon’s process is not centralized, and you can interview with multiple teams concurrently. To up your odds, interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.\n\nAmazon really loves their [Leadership Principles (LPs)](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles). Amazon interviewers may sandwich LP questions anywhere and everywhere throughout your interview rounds: coding rounds, system design rounds, all rounds. In short, at an Amazon interview, be prepared for Leadership Principles questions anywhere, anytime.\n\nFinally, Amazon has one of the more-structured interviewing cultures. They’re the only FAANG where interviewers exist in a formal hierarchy, and Amazon openly encourages and rewards interviewers who reach the top rung in that hierarchy.\n\nIn this guide we’ve compiled a comprehensive Amazon job interview prep guide based on in-depth discussions with Amazon interviewers and interviewees. Our guide includes a detailed walkthrough of the interview process, common questions and solutions, interview tips, video replays of mock Amazon interviews, and more.\n\n## An overview of Amazon's interview process and questions\n\nAmazon’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call OR online assessment\n*   Technical phone screen (if you didn’t do the online assessment)\n*   Onsite\n\nWe walk through each of these steps in detail below.\n\n![Amazon’s interview process: online assessment or recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Famazon-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Step 1: Online assessment or recruiter call\n\nWhether you start with an online assessment or an Amazon recruiter call depends on a few factors:\n\n*   Are you a mid-to-senior engineer?\n*   Have you previously interviewed at Amazon?\n*   Have you previously worked at a FAANG?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then you will likely not have to do an online assessment, and your first step will be a recruiter call. That said, we’ve gotten some conflicting reports from Amazonians, and it may be that Amazon has more recently started using online assessments to test the competencies of more senior engineers as well.\n\nIf you do the online assessment, here’s how it works. It’s a timed, asynchronous test consisting of several coding problems, conducted via [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). These are usually data structures and algorithm problems of easy to medium-level difficulty, as well as some multiple choice system design questions where you have to select the design option that’s ideal in a given situation. If you do well in the online assessment, you can skip the second step, which is the technical phone screen.\n\nIf you end up skipping the online assessment, the first step in your process will be a recruiter call. Please see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls.”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nAmazon’s technical phone interview is a coding interview that tends to focus exclusively on data structures and algorithms. Despite the focus on speed, [Amazon interview questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon) may require a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.\n\nFor these screens, Amazon uses an internal tool called Livecode, which has syntax highlighting for popular languages but does NOT have the ability to run the code. In fact, no code is ever compiled or run in Amazon technical interviews.\n\nFinally, there’s a 50% chance that your interviewer will throw in 1 or 2 Leadership Principles questions into the phone screen. They’re not guaranteed, but they’ll definitely come up during the onsite.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite interviews\n\nThere’s some variance, but the typical Amazon onsite, or in-person interview, for technical roles, will consist of:\n\n*   At least one behavioral round (this doesn’t include all the Leadership Principles questions peppered through the other interviews)\n*   Three coding rounds\n*   One system design round\n*   One hiring manager round\n\nAmazon has a special type of interviewer that they include in onsite loops: the Bar Raiser. These are typically senior-level Amazon employees at the top of the formal interviewer hierarchy, and they’re the toughest and most-trained interviewers at Amazon. They serve as an independent and objective evaluator, asking follow-up questions, and ensuring that hiring decisions are not influenced solely by the candidate's immediate team or department.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\n“Being a Bar Raiser makes an impact on your promotion packet. Every L5 nearing promotion at Amazon, is encouraged to do the Bar Raiser training. It’s a big input to get to L6 or L7. Part of the promotion packet is: how are you demonstrating some of the Leadership Principles. And “Hire and Develop the Best” is one of the LPs. There’s a lot of work to do in hiring to become a Bar Raiser: you have to do a lot of training and a ton of interviews. Being a Bar Raiser carries a lot of weight at Amazon if you want to get promoted.”\n\nAt Amazon, Bar Raisers and hiring managers are the only interviewers who have the formal authority to veto a hiring decision. You can recognize them because they are the only interviewer in your onsite loop who has nothing to do with the team you’re interviewing for. Bar Raiser rounds can be super intense, but don’t shrink when you feel a Bar Raiser throw flames your way; embrace the fire.\n\n## The three types of Amazon interview\n\nThere are three main types of interviews you’ll face as a software engineer interviewing at Amazon. These are coding, behavioral, and system design interviews.\n\n### 1\\. Coding interview\n\nYou will have to do coding interviews in the phone screen and in the onsite. Coding rounds at the onsite are very similar to technical phone screen rounds, except that in the technical phone screen you _might_ get Leadership Principles questions, whereas in the onsite coding portion, you definitely _will_.\n\nAmazon asks mostly medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions and avoids hard questions. The idea is to let candidates demonstrate how quickly they get to the optimal result, all in the service of hiring engineers who can churn out new features quickly.\n\nDespite the focus on speed, Amazon questions may be a complex problem that requires a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.\n\nAmazon’s coding rounds test the following technical skills:\n\n1.  Computer science fundamentals and knowledge of data structures and algorithms\n2.  The ability to write logical and maintainable code. These rounds require writing some classes and implementing some functions, e.g., “Implement some common functions of a file system”\n\nAlthough your performance in technical interviews matters (if you fail the technical, you usually will not move forward), it’s not as important as the outcome of the behavioral interview, and coding interviews during the onsite at Amazon actually feature Leadership Principles questions.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Amazon Interviewer\n\n“Because no code is ever run on an editor, the approach, speed, and testing are most important. Code syntax, typos, variable naming, and edge cases are less important.”\n\nGraph questions are among the most popular types of questions asked at Amazon, as well as tree questions that require BFS or DFS. Classic questions like LRU cache, meeting rooms, word break, word search, word ladder, and so on may also come up.\n\nWe’ve heard from Amazon interviewers that _all_ of the data structures and algorithms questions in Amazon’s official question bank are actually on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-amazon-questions/). That said, Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in coding rounds, and some will deviate from the question bank to ask more practical questions such as, “Implement a function with some behavior with the help of these two APIs…””\n\nFinally, like Facebook, Amazon shies away from dynamic programming questions (though they’re not banned outright).\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Amazon’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Amazon coding interview preparation resources](#amazon-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### 2\\. Behavioral interview\n\nThe behavioral interview is one of, along with coding interviews at the onsite, the most important in terms of leading to an offer.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\n“I’ve done over a hundred interviews at Amazon. The behavioral interview is most likely to get someone pushed over the line if they were borderline in their technical interviews. The opposite is not true: if they don’t meet the behavioral bar, we don’t care how they did in technicals, we aren’t hiring them.”\n\nBehavioral is an extremely important part of the Amazon interview process – Amazon is more likely to downlevel or reject you solely based on behavioral – and their behavioral round might be the most well-thought-out interview in all of big tech. It also might be the easiest to fail if you don’t specifically prepare for it. There’s no flavor like the flavor of an Amazonian behavioral interviewer; if you’ve never encountered it before and don’t expect it, it can be jarring.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes our users make is not taking this interview seriously because at most other companies, behavioral interviews tend to be more lip service than a meaningful part of the process. The bottom line is, if you want an Amazon job at a senior level or above, you have to seriously prepare for the behavioral interview questions.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nNot all Leadership Principles are created equal. Customer Obsession is the 👑one Leadership Principle to rule them all. When in doubt, demonstrate Customer Obsession. If you get a curveball, give an answer that shows you’re deeply committed to making things customers love.\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\n“If you have a bad LP round, or if LPs are problematic in the debrief, it’s almost always a ‘no hire.’ But if you have great LPs then there is a conversation where we try to see if the candidate can be hired even if the technical rounds weren't at the bar. But not the other way around. But if there’s anything ‘at the bar’ or ‘below the bar’ for LP, then you fail.”\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\n“If a candidate does not do that well on the technical round but they do well on LPs, there is always a possibility of recycling the candidate because they’re a good fit for Amazon but not good for the team. So sometimes we’ll help them interview with other teams, and they don’t have to do a full onsite: they just need to do 1-2 more rounds as a follow up. But if they’re below the bar for LPs, then they’re not a fit for Amazon so Amazon wouldn’t help set them up to other teams with shortened onsites.”\n\nIn this round, expect questions from all 5 of these categories:\n\n1.  Technical problem solving\n2.  Learning (and failure)\n3.  Getting stuff (for the business) done\n4.  Interpersonal conflict\n5.  Ambiguity\n\nHonestly, the best place to find a detailed question list for Amazon’s behavioral interview, as well as a bunch of other interview preparation resources, is our [Senior Engineer's Guide to the Amazon Leadership Principles Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles).\n\n### 3\\. System design interview\n\nSystem design and coding aren’t the be-all and end-all at Amazon – of course, you still have to pass them, but if your performance is borderline, doing well on behavioral Leadership Principles questions will take you over the finish line. In fact, interviewers will likely ask you 1-2 Leadership Principles questions in your system design interviews. Try to be efficient when answering LP questions in system design rounds. LPs come first. Finish them early so that you have more time for the technical question.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Amazon Interviewer\n\n“In many debriefs, I hear the hiring manager say that we can extend the L5 offer with the understanding that system design is not their strength, but it's coachable. At the L6 level, the system design bar is comparable to Facebook or Google.”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you’re in a system design round at Amazon, and you don’t know what to talk about, talk about performance. They want Amazon to be the number one customer of AWS. And they love to find engineers who understand and are passionate about fine tuning performance in the cloud.\n\nAmazon is more likely to ask you practical system design questions. For example, if you’re interviewing with a team who controls Amazon’s inventory management, they might ask you to design a piece of an inventory management system.\n\nOther common system design questions include:\n\n*   Design autocomplete\n*   Design file upload/download to the cloud\n*   Design search\n\nThe design questions are most likely about designing well-known features, as opposed to a complete system from scratch like Design Facebook or Twitter.\n\nAmazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in system design, but a lot of interviewers fall back on reusing questions from Amazon’s question bank.\n\nFor tooling in system design interviews, candidates can usually choose any type of drawing tool. [Excalidraw](https://app.excalidraw.com/) is most popular, followed by [Miro](https://miro.com/).\n\n## How Amazon makes hiring decisions\n\nAmazon has one of the more well-structured decision-making processes in tech: teams typically do a pre-brief (live meeting before the onsite), submit asynchronous feedback, and also do a debrief (live meeting after the onsite). They rely heavily on live discussion to make decisions. Notably, though some interviewers might be able to tell an outlier story of a time a regular interviewer out-argued a Bar Raiser, most of the time the interviewers go along with what the Bar Raiser says.\n\nAmazon interviewer’s grade on a 5-point scale: Strongly Inclined, Inclined, Neutral, Not Inclined, Strongly Not Inclined.\n\nThe two most important interviewers at the onsite are the Bar Raiser and the hiring manager. At Amazon, all of the other team members involved in the interview could vote to hire, but if the Bar Raiser _or_ the hiring manager aren’t on board, that candidate is likely getting rejected.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nAt Amazon, identify the Bar Raiser (the only person whose work has nothing to do with the team for which you’re interviewing) and the hiring manager (if you don’t know who it is, ask the recruiter before the onsite or an interviewer if during the onsite). Most of your energy should go towards impressing these two people – since Amazon relies so heavily on live discussions to make hiring decisions, impression management is more impactful here.\n\n## Resources to prepare yourself for an Amazon coding interview\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Amazon content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Amazon interviewers, long-form solutions to common Amazon questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Amazon interviews.\n\n### Videos of mock interviews conducted by Amazon interviewers\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Amazon interviewers on our platform.

Amazon isn’t a sports team or a family; they’re a motley crew of Terminators. They’re a different breed with notoriously high standards. They reward aggression. And they want to take over the market (or the earth, depending on who you ask)...\n\nAmazon’s process is not centralized, and you can interview with multiple teams concurrently. To up your odds, interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.\n\nAmazon really loves their [Leadership Principles (LPs)](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles). Amazon interviewers may sandwich LP questions anywhere and everywhere throughout your interview rounds: coding rounds, system design rounds, all rounds. In short, at an Amazon interview, be prepared for Leadership Principles questions anywhere, anytime.\n\nFinally, Amazon has one of the more-structured interviewing cultures. They’re the only FAANG where interviewers exist in a formal hierarchy, and Amazon openly encourages and rewards interviewers who reach the top rung in that hierarchy.\n\nIn this guide we’ve compiled a comprehensive Amazon job interview prep guide based on in-depth discussions with Amazon interviewers and interviewees. Our guide includes a detailed walkthrough of the interview process, common questions and solutions, interview tips, video replays of mock Amazon interviews, and more.\n\n## An overview of Amazon's interview process and questions\n\nAmazon’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call OR online assessment\n*   Technical phone screen (if you didn’t do the online assessment)\n*   Onsite\n\nWe walk through each of these steps in detail below.\n\n![Amazon’s interview process: online assessment or recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Famazon-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Step 1: Online assessment or recruiter call\n\nWhether you start with an online assessment or an Amazon recruiter call depends on a few factors:\n\n*   Are you a mid-to-senior engineer?\n*   Have you previously interviewed at Amazon?\n*   Have you previously worked at a FAANG?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then you will likely not have to do an online assessment, and your first step will be a recruiter call. That said, we’ve gotten some conflicting reports from Amazonians, and it may be that Amazon has more recently started using online assessments to test the competencies of more senior engineers as well.\n\nIf you do the online assessment, here’s how it works. It’s a timed, asynchronous test consisting of several coding problems, conducted via [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). These are usually data structures and algorithm problems of easy to medium-level difficulty, as well as some multiple choice system design questions where you have to select the design option that’s ideal in a given situation. If you do well in the online assessment, you can skip the second step, which is the technical phone screen.\n\nIf you end up skipping the online assessment, the first step in your process will be a recruiter call. Please see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls.”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone screen\n\nAmazon’s technical phone interview is a coding interview that tends to focus exclusively on data structures and algorithms. Despite the focus on speed, [Amazon interview questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon) may require a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.\n\nFor these screens, Amazon uses an internal tool called Livecode, which has syntax highlighting for popular languages but does NOT have the ability to run the code. In fact, no code is ever compiled or run in Amazon technical interviews.\n\nFinally, there’s a 50% chance that your interviewer will throw in 1 or 2 Leadership Principles questions into the phone screen. They’re not guaranteed, but they’ll definitely come up during the onsite.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite interviews\n\nThere’s some variance, but the typical Amazon onsite, or in-person interview, for technical roles, will consist of:\n\n*   At least one behavioral round (this doesn’t include all the Leadership Principles questions peppered through the other interviews)\n*   Three coding rounds\n*   One system design round\n*   One hiring manager round\n\nAmazon has a special type of interviewer that they include in onsite loops: the Bar Raiser. These are typically senior-level Amazon employees at the top of the formal interviewer hierarchy, and they’re the toughest and most-trained interviewers at Amazon. They serve as an independent and objective evaluator, asking follow-up questions, and ensuring that hiring decisions are not influenced solely by the candidate's immediate team or department.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\n“Being a Bar Raiser makes an impact on your promotion packet. Every L5 nearing promotion at Amazon, is encouraged to do the Bar Raiser training. It’s a big input to get to L6 or L7. Part of the promotion packet is: how are you demonstrating some of the Leadership Principles. And “Hire and Develop the Best” is one of the LPs. There’s a lot of work to do in hiring to become a Bar Raiser: you have to do a lot of training and a ton of interviews. Being a Bar Raiser carries a lot of weight at Amazon if you want to get promoted.”\n\nAt Amazon, Bar Raisers and hiring managers are the only interviewers who have the formal authority to veto a hiring decision. You can recognize them because they are the only interviewer in your onsite loop who has nothing to do with the team you’re interviewing for. Bar Raiser rounds can be super intense, but don’t shrink when you feel a Bar Raiser throw flames your way; embrace the fire.\n\n## The three types of Amazon interview\n\nThere are three main types of interviews you’ll face as a software engineer interviewing at Amazon. These are coding, behavioral, and system design interviews.\n\n### 1\\. Coding interview\n\nYou will have to do coding interviews in the phone screen and in the onsite. Coding rounds at the onsite are very similar to technical phone screen rounds, except that in the technical phone screen you _might_ get Leadership Principles questions, whereas in the onsite coding portion, you definitely _will_.\n\nAmazon asks mostly medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions and avoids hard questions. The idea is to let candidates demonstrate how quickly they get to the optimal result, all in the service of hiring engineers who can churn out new features quickly.\n\nDespite the focus on speed, Amazon questions may be a complex problem that requires a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.\n\nAmazon’s coding rounds test the following technical skills:\n\n1.  Computer science fundamentals and knowledge of data structures and algorithms\n2.  The ability to write logical and maintainable code. These rounds require writing some classes and implementing some functions, e.g., “Implement some common functions of a file system”\n\nAlthough your performance in technical interviews matters (if you fail the technical, you usually will not move forward), it’s not as important as the outcome of the behavioral interview, and coding interviews during the onsite at Amazon actually feature Leadership Principles questions.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Amazon Interviewer\n\n“Because no code is ever run on an editor, the approach, speed, and testing are most important. Code syntax, typos, variable naming, and edge cases are less important.”\n\nGraph questions are among the most popular types of questions asked at Amazon, as well as tree questions that require BFS or DFS. Classic questions like LRU cache, meeting rooms, word break, word search, word ladder, and so on may also come up.\n\nWe’ve heard from Amazon interviewers that _all_ of the data structures and algorithms questions in Amazon’s official question bank are actually on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-amazon-questions/). That said, Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in coding rounds, and some will deviate from the question bank to ask more practical questions such as, “Implement a function with some behavior with the help of these two APIs…””\n\nFinally, like Facebook, Amazon shies away from dynamic programming questions (though they’re not banned outright).\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Amazon’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Amazon coding interview preparation resources](#amazon-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### 2\\. Behavioral interview\n\nThe behavioral interview is one of, along with coding interviews at the onsite, the most important in terms of leading to an offer.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon\n\n“I’ve done over a hundred interviews at Amazon. The behavioral interview is most likely to get someone pushed over the line if they were borderline in their technical interviews. The opposite is not true: if they don’t meet the behavioral bar, we don’t care how they did in technicals, we aren’t hiring them.”\n\nBehavioral is an extremely important part of the Amazon interview process – Amazon is more likely to downlevel or reject you solely based on behavioral – and their behavioral round might be the most well-thought-out interview in all of big tech. It also might be the easiest to fail if you don’t specifically prepare for it. There’s no flavor like the flavor of an Amazonian behavioral interviewer; if you’ve never encountered it before and don’t expect it, it can be jarring.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes our users make is not taking this interview seriously because at most other companies, behavioral interviews tend to be more lip service than a meaningful part of the process. The bottom line is, if you want an Amazon job at a senior level or above, you have to seriously prepare for the behavioral interview questions.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nNot all Leadership Principles are created equal. Customer Obsession is the 👑one Leadership Principle to rule them all. When in doubt, demonstrate Customer Obsession. If you get a curveball, give an answer that shows you’re deeply committed to making things customers love.\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\n“If you have a bad LP round, or if LPs are problematic in the debrief, it’s almost always a ‘no hire.’ But if you have great LPs then there is a conversation where we try to see if the candidate can be hired even if the technical rounds weren't at the bar. But not the other way around. But if there’s anything ‘at the bar’ or ‘below the bar’ for LP, then you fail.”\n\n#### Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser\n\n“If a candidate does not do that well on the technical round but they do well on LPs, there is always a possibility of recycling the candidate because they’re a good fit for Amazon but not good for the team. So sometimes we’ll help them interview with other teams, and they don’t have to do a full onsite: they just need to do 1-2 more rounds as a follow up. But if they’re below the bar for LPs, then they’re not a fit for Amazon so Amazon wouldn’t help set them up to other teams with shortened onsites.”\n\nIn this round, expect questions from all 5 of these categories:\n\n1.  Technical problem solving\n2.  Learning (and failure)\n3.  Getting stuff (for the business) done\n4.  Interpersonal conflict\n5.  Ambiguity\n\nHonestly, the best place to find a detailed question list for Amazon’s behavioral interview, as well as a bunch of other interview preparation resources, is our [Senior Engineer's Guide to the Amazon Leadership Principles Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles).\n\n### 3\\. System design interview\n\nSystem design and coding aren’t the be-all and end-all at Amazon – of course, you still have to pass them, but if your performance is borderline, doing well on behavioral Leadership Principles questions will take you over the finish line. In fact, interviewers will likely ask you 1-2 Leadership Principles questions in your system design interviews. Try to be efficient when answering LP questions in system design rounds. LPs come first. Finish them early so that you have more time for the technical question.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Amazon Interviewer\n\n“In many debriefs, I hear the hiring manager say that we can extend the L5 offer with the understanding that system design is not their strength, but it's coachable. At the L6 level, the system design bar is comparable to Facebook or Google.”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you’re in a system design round at Amazon, and you don’t know what to talk about, talk about performance. They want Amazon to be the number one customer of AWS. And they love to find engineers who understand and are passionate about fine tuning performance in the cloud.\n\nAmazon is more likely to ask you practical system design questions. For example, if you’re interviewing with a team who controls Amazon’s inventory management, they might ask you to design a piece of an inventory management system.\n\nOther common system design questions include:\n\n*   Design autocomplete\n*   Design file upload/download to the cloud\n*   Design search\n\nThe design questions are most likely about designing well-known features, as opposed to a complete system from scratch like Design Facebook or Twitter.\n\nAmazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in system design, but a lot of interviewers fall back on reusing questions from Amazon’s question bank.\n\nFor tooling in system design interviews, candidates can usually choose any type of drawing tool. [Excalidraw](https://app.excalidraw.com/) is most popular, followed by [Miro](https://miro.com/).\n\n## How Amazon makes hiring decisions\n\nAmazon has one of the more well-structured decision-making processes in tech: teams typically do a pre-brief (live meeting before the onsite), submit asynchronous feedback, and also do a debrief (live meeting after the onsite). They rely heavily on live discussion to make decisions. Notably, though some interviewers might be able to tell an outlier story of a time a regular interviewer out-argued a Bar Raiser, most of the time the interviewers go along with what the Bar Raiser says.\n\nAmazon interviewer’s grade on a 5-point scale: Strongly Inclined, Inclined, Neutral, Not Inclined, Strongly Not Inclined.\n\nThe two most important interviewers at the onsite are the Bar Raiser and the hiring manager. At Amazon, all of the other team members involved in the interview could vote to hire, but if the Bar Raiser _or_ the hiring manager aren’t on board, that candidate is likely getting rejected.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nAt Amazon, identify the Bar Raiser (the only person whose work has nothing to do with the team for which you’re interviewing) and the hiring manager (if you don’t know who it is, ask the recruiter before the onsite or an interviewer if during the onsite). Most of your energy should go towards impressing these two people – since Amazon relies so heavily on live discussions to make hiring decisions, impression management is more impactful here.\n\n## Resources to prepare yourself for an Amazon coding interview\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Amazon content for you!

Microsoft’s interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Microsoft’s interview process and questions\n\nMicrosoft’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call (and a hiring manager call from principal engineers and above)\n*   Technical phone interview or Codility quiz\n*   Onsite interviews\n*   Team matching\n\n![Microsoft’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen or Codility quiz, onsite, team matching](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fmicrosoft-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Microsoft’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nMicrosoft lets you interview with different teams at the same time; if you want to maximize your chances interview with several of them simultaneously.\n\nMicrosoft’s process is mainly (though not fully!) team-dependent. That means that while you interview for a specific team, you may not necessarily be interviewing _just_ with people on that team. For example, sometimes you might interview with the hiring manager for a specific team, and your other interviewers will be individual contributors from other teams.\n\nEach team runs their own processes, which can vary quite a bit from team to team as well. Sometimes Microsoft bakes a quasi-team-matching activity into an interview process: where a candidate can meet multiple hiring managers in the same loop. Another variation is some candidates’ first round screens are with a hiring manager instead of a recruiter.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical interview (phone screen or a Codility quiz)\n\nMicrosoft’s technical phone screen is a traditional LeetCode-style coding interview, with technical questions ranging from easy to medium. Interviewers aren’t given a rubric. Some of them get training, others don’t. They have freedom to ask whatever they want and judge your technical skills however they want in this round.\n\nIf you end up getting the asynchronous [Codility](https://www.codility.com/) quiz instead, you sign on and have to answer several algorithmic questions in a short amount of time. In some ways, this is harder than the technical phone screen with the human because if you don’t pass the test cases, you get filtered out. You’re judged on several factors including: test cases, correctness, and code quality.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe onsite format can vary per org, but it typically includes the following round of interviews:\n\n*   One behavioral round of behavioral interview questions\n*   Two or three coding rounds\n*   One system design round\n*   One domain-specific round\n\n## Microsoft’s interview types in detail\n\n### Coding\n\nThis is the most important round at Microsoft.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Since most engineers at Microsoft use C#, if you can, you should use C#, Java, or Python in the technical rounds. This way, your interviewer will be able to understand your code better and may even be able to help.”\n\nMicrosoft usually asks LeetCode-style medium-difficulty questions in coding rounds. Interviewers get to pick their own coding questions, but, according to interviewers, Microsoft favors the following topics (in no particular order):\n\n*   Arrays and strings\n*   Linked lists\n*   Graphs and trees\n\n[LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/) is also a helpful resource.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Tree questions are most popular, e.g., various types of tree sum, tree traversals of certain orders, subtrees, etc.”\n\nDynamic programming used to basically never happen, but now it’s a little more common. When you do get dynamic programming problems, it’s usually the classic ones like coin change, stair steps, edit distance, and various types of counting problems.\n\nTooling for coding interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many teams use Codility.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Microsoft’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Microsoft coding interview preparation resources](#microsoft-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nSystem design is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft, and it’s sometimes conducted by a hiring manager. One idiosyncratic aspect of Microsoft’s process is their penchant for asking questions about compliance-related topics.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“My Microsoft interview was insanely easy. I tried to step it up when I started being an interviewer at Microsoft. But then I realized that's how it has to be. Technical is like 25% of it. It’s not a generic FAANG interview. It’s more about three things: a) ‘How well does this candidate know this system they’re going to be working on?’, b) ‘How do they meet the exact needs we have on this team?’, and c) ‘Do they understand the little things we value? Like compliance, manipulating data, data pipelines, EU data processing, etc.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Microsoft is obsessed with the details of compliance. I don’t think I have seen a system that is as set up for auditing as Microsoft. Employees are asked to log so much. There’s a centralized grid system which is built into Azure. All logs are to be routed into that. This allows for centralized log spanning and auditing. Which I have not seen anywhere else.”\n\nOutside of compliance-related questions, here are examples of other system design questions you might encounter:\n\n*   Let's go back in time, how would you ship cargo to customers? Discuss an approach that touches on availability, latency, reliability, communication, etc.\n*   Let's say we are interested in palindromes and we want to store them durably whenever we come up with them. Design a system that lets you enter a new palindrome every time someone comes up with one, and allows users to check if a palindrome exists in a system.\n*   Assume you are a teacher and you want to test students if they know the country names correctly. You are provided a list of countries and pictures. Design a webpage + backend API that mimics a test for students to evaluate their knowledge (this would be for a full-stack role).\n\nTooling for system design interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many Microsoft employees use Codility Canvas or Excalidraw.\n\n### Domain-specific round\n\nThe domain-specific round is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft. Microsoft is more likely to do these types of rounds than other FAANGs, and these rounds can feel similar to system design but involve some coding.\n\nUsually, domain-specific rounds are customized to the domain a given team works on and dives deep into that technology. So, whatever area this team is in (cloud networking, big data, etc.), that’s what they’ll ask you about.\n\nOn some occasions, Microsoft customizes a round to the candidate’s skills. For example, if you’re a backend engineer, they might ask you to design an API or design a database. They also may ask you open ended trivia questions about the programming language you are most familiar with.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Another thing that happens in these rounds is they’ll ask you to discuss a complicated problem you have solved at your job. It's good for candidates to prepare to discuss 2-3 projects in detail: how did they implement caching, deal with scaling issues, and so on.”\n\nFinally, you may get a scenario question that’s commensurate with your skill set. For instance, if you’re a back-end engineer, you may get a question like, “Imagine you're in a team and we're building a credit card registration system. And it's used by different firms. How do you build the interface?”\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis is the least important round at Microsoft: the lowest effort way to pass is to not blame your teammates, not show red flags, and stay positive.\n\nMicrosoft doesn’t have a specific set of traits they’re looking for. You can expect the usual questions about your strengths and weaknesses, failure, conflicts with colleagues, projects, and lessons you’ve learned from past experiences in your career.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“A lot of people struggle with ‘What are your top 2 strengths and weaknesses?’ probably because they are trying to make up an answer on the spot. Good to prep answers to typical behavioral questions in advance.”\n\nUltimately, they are screening for three soft skills: positivity, ownership, and communication. They want to hire friendly people who can do the work and not blame others. This is not Apple or Netflix, where they want a particular flavor of personality, or where they ask interviewers to hire candidates they’d like to befriend. It’s more neutral.\n\nBehavioral rounds can sometimes have a coding component as well. When this happens, it might be an easy/medium-difficulty 20-min LeetCode-style problem.\n\n## How Microsoft makes hiring decisions\n\nInterviewers grade candidates on different scales, depending on the team.\n\nSome orgs have an asynchronous feedback process, other orgs rely on live discussion, and still-other orgs do both. Some orgs have rubrics, and others don’t. Here’s how a rubric looks at one org:\n\n*   Junior: Has growth mindset, seeks to understand ideas\n*   Senior: Drives self development, models openness, failure is okay, open to different ideas\n*   Principal: Consistently challenges group thinking towards productive discussion\n\n## Microsoft coding interview preparation resources\n\nHere are a few more interview tips and resources to help you prep for a software developer or software engineer interview at Microsoft.\n\n*   Microsoft interviewers can ask whatever questions they want, yet some interviewers repeat questions, so [LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/) is somewhat helpful.\n*   Study up on the services the team you’re interviewing with uses.\n*   Ask your recruiter for specifics about your rounds. If you get nothing helpful, then practice practical questions, LeetCode-style questions, and domain-specific questions.\n\nIn addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Microsoft content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Microsoft interviewers, long-form solutions to common Microsoft questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Microsoft interviews.\n\n### Microsoft interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Microsoft interviewers on our platform.

Microsoft’s interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Microsoft’s interview process and questions\n\nMicrosoft’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call (and a hiring manager call from principal engineers and above)\n*   Technical phone interview or Codility quiz\n*   Onsite interviews\n*   Team matching\n\n![Microsoft’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen or Codility quiz, onsite, team matching](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fmicrosoft-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Microsoft’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nMicrosoft lets you interview with different teams at the same time; if you want to maximize your chances interview with several of them simultaneously.\n\nMicrosoft’s process is mainly (though not fully!) team-dependent. That means that while you interview for a specific team, you may not necessarily be interviewing _just_ with people on that team. For example, sometimes you might interview with the hiring manager for a specific team, and your other interviewers will be individual contributors from other teams.\n\nEach team runs their own processes, which can vary quite a bit from team to team as well. Sometimes Microsoft bakes a quasi-team-matching activity into an interview process: where a candidate can meet multiple hiring managers in the same loop. Another variation is some candidates’ first round screens are with a hiring manager instead of a recruiter.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical interview (phone screen or a Codility quiz)\n\nMicrosoft’s technical phone screen is a traditional LeetCode-style coding interview, with technical questions ranging from easy to medium. Interviewers aren’t given a rubric. Some of them get training, others don’t. They have freedom to ask whatever they want and judge your technical skills however they want in this round.\n\nIf you end up getting the asynchronous [Codility](https://www.codility.com/) quiz instead, you sign on and have to answer several algorithmic questions in a short amount of time. In some ways, this is harder than the technical phone screen with the human because if you don’t pass the test cases, you get filtered out. You’re judged on several factors including: test cases, correctness, and code quality.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe onsite format can vary per org, but it typically includes the following round of interviews:\n\n*   One behavioral round of behavioral interview questions\n*   Two or three coding rounds\n*   One system design round\n*   One domain-specific round\n\n## Microsoft’s interview types in detail\n\n### Coding\n\nThis is the most important round at Microsoft.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Since most engineers at Microsoft use C#, if you can, you should use C#, Java, or Python in the technical rounds. This way, your interviewer will be able to understand your code better and may even be able to help.”\n\nMicrosoft usually asks LeetCode-style medium-difficulty questions in coding rounds. Interviewers get to pick their own coding questions, but, according to interviewers, Microsoft favors the following topics (in no particular order):\n\n*   Arrays and strings\n*   Linked lists\n*   Graphs and trees\n\n[LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/) is also a helpful resource.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Tree questions are most popular, e.g., various types of tree sum, tree traversals of certain orders, subtrees, etc.”\n\nDynamic programming used to basically never happen, but now it’s a little more common. When you do get dynamic programming problems, it’s usually the classic ones like coin change, stair steps, edit distance, and various types of counting problems.\n\nTooling for coding interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many teams use Codility.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Microsoft’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Microsoft coding interview preparation resources](#microsoft-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nSystem design is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft, and it’s sometimes conducted by a hiring manager. One idiosyncratic aspect of Microsoft’s process is their penchant for asking questions about compliance-related topics.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“My Microsoft interview was insanely easy. I tried to step it up when I started being an interviewer at Microsoft. But then I realized that's how it has to be. Technical is like 25% of it. It’s not a generic FAANG interview. It’s more about three things: a) ‘How well does this candidate know this system they’re going to be working on?’, b) ‘How do they meet the exact needs we have on this team?’, and c) ‘Do they understand the little things we value? Like compliance, manipulating data, data pipelines, EU data processing, etc.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Microsoft is obsessed with the details of compliance. I don’t think I have seen a system that is as set up for auditing as Microsoft. Employees are asked to log so much. There’s a centralized grid system which is built into Azure. All logs are to be routed into that. This allows for centralized log spanning and auditing. Which I have not seen anywhere else.”\n\nOutside of compliance-related questions, here are examples of other system design questions you might encounter:\n\n*   Let's go back in time, how would you ship cargo to customers? Discuss an approach that touches on availability, latency, reliability, communication, etc.\n*   Let's say we are interested in palindromes and we want to store them durably whenever we come up with them. Design a system that lets you enter a new palindrome every time someone comes up with one, and allows users to check if a palindrome exists in a system.\n*   Assume you are a teacher and you want to test students if they know the country names correctly. You are provided a list of countries and pictures. Design a webpage + backend API that mimics a test for students to evaluate their knowledge (this would be for a full-stack role).\n\nTooling for system design interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many Microsoft employees use Codility Canvas or Excalidraw.\n\n### Domain-specific round\n\nThe domain-specific round is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft. Microsoft is more likely to do these types of rounds than other FAANGs, and these rounds can feel similar to system design but involve some coding.\n\nUsually, domain-specific rounds are customized to the domain a given team works on and dives deep into that technology. So, whatever area this team is in (cloud networking, big data, etc.), that’s what they’ll ask you about.\n\nOn some occasions, Microsoft customizes a round to the candidate’s skills. For example, if you’re a backend engineer, they might ask you to design an API or design a database. They also may ask you open ended trivia questions about the programming language you are most familiar with.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Another thing that happens in these rounds is they’ll ask you to discuss a complicated problem you have solved at your job. It's good for candidates to prepare to discuss 2-3 projects in detail: how did they implement caching, deal with scaling issues, and so on.”\n\nFinally, you may get a scenario question that’s commensurate with your skill set. For instance, if you’re a back-end engineer, you may get a question like, “Imagine you're in a team and we're building a credit card registration system. And it's used by different firms. How do you build the interface?”\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis is the least important round at Microsoft: the lowest effort way to pass is to not blame your teammates, not show red flags, and stay positive.\n\nMicrosoft doesn’t have a specific set of traits they’re looking for. You can expect the usual questions about your strengths and weaknesses, failure, conflicts with colleagues, projects, and lessons you’ve learned from past experiences in your career.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“A lot of people struggle with ‘What are your top 2 strengths and weaknesses?’ probably because they are trying to make up an answer on the spot. Good to prep answers to typical behavioral questions in advance.”\n\nUltimately, they are screening for three soft skills: positivity, ownership, and communication. They want to hire friendly people who can do the work and not blame others. This is not Apple or Netflix, where they want a particular flavor of personality, or where they ask interviewers to hire candidates they’d like to befriend. It’s more neutral.\n\nBehavioral rounds can sometimes have a coding component as well. When this happens, it might be an easy/medium-difficulty 20-min LeetCode-style problem.\n\n## How Microsoft makes hiring decisions\n\nInterviewers grade candidates on different scales, depending on the team.\n\nSome orgs have an asynchronous feedback process, other orgs rely on live discussion, and still-other orgs do both. Some orgs have rubrics, and others don’t. Here’s how a rubric looks at one org:\n\n*   Junior: Has growth mindset, seeks to understand ideas\n*   Senior: Drives self development, models openness, failure is okay, open to different ideas\n*   Principal: Consistently challenges group thinking towards productive discussion\n\n## Microsoft coding interview preparation resources\n\nHere are a few more interview tips and resources to help you prep for a software developer or software engineer interview at Microsoft.\n\n*   Microsoft interviewers can ask whatever questions they want, yet some interviewers repeat questions, so [LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/) is somewhat helpful.\n*   Study up on the services the team you’re interviewing with uses.\n*   Ask your recruiter for specifics about your rounds. If you get nothing helpful, then practice practical questions, LeetCode-style questions, and domain-specific questions.\n\nIn addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Microsoft content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Microsoft interviewers, long-form solutions to common Microsoft questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Microsoft interviews.\n\n### Microsoft interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Microsoft interviewers on our platform.

Microsoft’s interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Microsoft’s interview process and questions\n\nMicrosoft’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call (and a hiring manager call from principal engineers and above)\n*   Technical phone interview or Codility quiz\n*   Onsite interviews\n*   Team matching\n\n![Microsoft’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen or Codility quiz, onsite, team matching](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fmicrosoft-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Microsoft’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nMicrosoft lets you interview with different teams at the same time; if you want to maximize your chances interview with several of them simultaneously.\n\nMicrosoft’s process is mainly (though not fully!) team-dependent. That means that while you interview for a specific team, you may not necessarily be interviewing _just_ with people on that team. For example, sometimes you might interview with the hiring manager for a specific team, and your other interviewers will be individual contributors from other teams.\n\nEach team runs their own processes, which can vary quite a bit from team to team as well. Sometimes Microsoft bakes a quasi-team-matching activity into an interview process: where a candidate can meet multiple hiring managers in the same loop. Another variation is some candidates’ first round screens are with a hiring manager instead of a recruiter.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Technical interview (phone screen or a Codility quiz)\n\nMicrosoft’s technical phone screen is a traditional LeetCode-style coding interview, with technical questions ranging from easy to medium. Interviewers aren’t given a rubric. Some of them get training, others don’t. They have freedom to ask whatever they want and judge your technical skills however they want in this round.\n\nIf you end up getting the asynchronous [Codility](https://www.codility.com/) quiz instead, you sign on and have to answer several algorithmic questions in a short amount of time. In some ways, this is harder than the technical phone screen with the human because if you don’t pass the test cases, you get filtered out. You’re judged on several factors including: test cases, correctness, and code quality.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThe onsite format can vary per org, but it typically includes the following round of interviews:\n\n*   One behavioral round of behavioral interview questions\n*   Two or three coding rounds\n*   One system design round\n*   One domain-specific round\n\n## Microsoft’s interview types in detail\n\n### Coding\n\nThis is the most important round at Microsoft.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Since most engineers at Microsoft use C#, if you can, you should use C#, Java, or Python in the technical rounds. This way, your interviewer will be able to understand your code better and may even be able to help.”\n\nMicrosoft usually asks LeetCode-style medium-difficulty questions in coding rounds. Interviewers get to pick their own coding questions, but, according to interviewers, Microsoft favors the following topics (in no particular order):\n\n*   Arrays and strings\n*   Linked lists\n*   Graphs and trees\n\n[LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/) is also a helpful resource.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Tree questions are most popular, e.g., various types of tree sum, tree traversals of certain orders, subtrees, etc.”\n\nDynamic programming used to basically never happen, but now it’s a little more common. When you do get dynamic programming problems, it’s usually the classic ones like coin change, stair steps, edit distance, and various types of counting problems.\n\nTooling for coding interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many teams use Codility.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Microsoft’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Microsoft coding interview preparation resources](#microsoft-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nSystem design is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft, and it’s sometimes conducted by a hiring manager. One idiosyncratic aspect of Microsoft’s process is their penchant for asking questions about compliance-related topics.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“My Microsoft interview was insanely easy. I tried to step it up when I started being an interviewer at Microsoft. But then I realized that's how it has to be. Technical is like 25% of it. It’s not a generic FAANG interview. It’s more about three things: a) ‘How well does this candidate know this system they’re going to be working on?’, b) ‘How do they meet the exact needs we have on this team?’, and c) ‘Do they understand the little things we value? Like compliance, manipulating data, data pipelines, EU data processing, etc.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Microsoft is obsessed with the details of compliance. I don’t think I have seen a system that is as set up for auditing as Microsoft. Employees are asked to log so much. There’s a centralized grid system which is built into Azure. All logs are to be routed into that. This allows for centralized log spanning and auditing. Which I have not seen anywhere else.”\n\nOutside of compliance-related questions, here are examples of other system design questions you might encounter:\n\n*   Let's go back in time, how would you ship cargo to customers? Discuss an approach that touches on availability, latency, reliability, communication, etc.\n*   Let's say we are interested in palindromes and we want to store them durably whenever we come up with them. Design a system that lets you enter a new palindrome every time someone comes up with one, and allows users to check if a palindrome exists in a system.\n*   Assume you are a teacher and you want to test students if they know the country names correctly. You are provided a list of countries and pictures. Design a webpage + backend API that mimics a test for students to evaluate their knowledge (this would be for a full-stack role).\n\nTooling for system design interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many Microsoft employees use Codility Canvas or Excalidraw.\n\n### Domain-specific round\n\nThe domain-specific round is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft. Microsoft is more likely to do these types of rounds than other FAANGs, and these rounds can feel similar to system design but involve some coding.\n\nUsually, domain-specific rounds are customized to the domain a given team works on and dives deep into that technology. So, whatever area this team is in (cloud networking, big data, etc.), that’s what they’ll ask you about.\n\nOn some occasions, Microsoft customizes a round to the candidate’s skills. For example, if you’re a backend engineer, they might ask you to design an API or design a database. They also may ask you open ended trivia questions about the programming language you are most familiar with.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“Another thing that happens in these rounds is they’ll ask you to discuss a complicated problem you have solved at your job. It's good for candidates to prepare to discuss 2-3 projects in detail: how did they implement caching, deal with scaling issues, and so on.”\n\nFinally, you may get a scenario question that’s commensurate with your skill set. For instance, if you’re a back-end engineer, you may get a question like, “Imagine you're in a team and we're building a credit card registration system. And it's used by different firms. How do you build the interface?”\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThis is the least important round at Microsoft: the lowest effort way to pass is to not blame your teammates, not show red flags, and stay positive.\n\nMicrosoft doesn’t have a specific set of traits they’re looking for. You can expect the usual questions about your strengths and weaknesses, failure, conflicts with colleagues, projects, and lessons you’ve learned from past experiences in your career.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer\n\n“A lot of people struggle with ‘What are your top 2 strengths and weaknesses?’ probably because they are trying to make up an answer on the spot. Good to prep answers to typical behavioral questions in advance.”\n\nUltimately, they are screening for three soft skills: positivity, ownership, and communication. They want to hire friendly people who can do the work and not blame others. This is not Apple or Netflix, where they want a particular flavor of personality, or where they ask interviewers to hire candidates they’d like to befriend. It’s more neutral.\n\nBehavioral rounds can sometimes have a coding component as well. When this happens, it might be an easy/medium-difficulty 20-min LeetCode-style problem.\n\n## How Microsoft makes hiring decisions\n\nInterviewers grade candidates on different scales, depending on the team.\n\nSome orgs have an asynchronous feedback process, other orgs rely on live discussion, and still-other orgs do both. Some orgs have rubrics, and others don’t. Here’s how a rubric looks at one org:\n\n*   Junior: Has growth mindset, seeks to understand ideas\n*   Senior: Drives self development, models openness, failure is okay, open to different ideas\n*   Principal: Consistently challenges group thinking towards productive discussion\n\n## Microsoft coding interview preparation resources\n\nHere are a few more interview tips and resources to help you prep for a software developer or software engineer interview at Microsoft.\n\n*   Microsoft interviewers can ask whatever questions they want, yet some interviewers repeat questions, so [LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-microsoft-questions/) is somewhat helpful.\n*   Study up on the services the team you’re interviewing with uses.\n*   Ask your recruiter for specifics about your rounds. If you get nothing helpful, then practice practical questions, LeetCode-style questions, and domain-specific questions.\n\nIn addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Microsoft content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Microsoft interviewers, long-form solutions to common Microsoft questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Microsoft interviews.\n\n### Microsoft interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Microsoft interviewers on our platform.

Netflix’s interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Netflix’s interview process and questions\n\nNetflix’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call\n*   Hiring manager screen\n*   Technical phone interview\n*   A very long onsite\n\n![Netflix’s interview process: recruiter call, hiring manager screen, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fnetflix-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Netflix’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nEvery human organization views themselves as a metaphor; Netflix doesn’t view themselves as a family like some other tech companies, they view themselves as a high-caliber sports team (in fact, Netflix calls their employees a “dream team”). They explain this metaphor themselves in their infamous culture memo.\n\nFinally, Netflix’s interview process is decentralized and team-dependent. Moreover, you can interview with multiple teams at Netflix concurrently, which can help you increase your odds of securing a job offer.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Hiring manager screen\n\nThis is a 30 minute call. A former Netflix employee called this round “Very chill, especially compared to the onsite.” This round consists of bidirectional surface-level questions.\n\nThe hiring manager will also be selling you on Netflix. Hiring managers doing selling is business as usual, but in this case, it serves an additional purpose – because their onsite is by far the most intense, they have to sell harder upfront because the onsite is a bigger commitment for the candidates.\n\n### Step 3: Technical phone screen\n\nThe Netflix technical phone screen is a coding interview that typically lasts 45-60 minutes. There is significant inter-team variation on what these interviews cover, and the tooling you use during these interviews also varies by team,\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nOnsite interview structure varies from team to team, but you’ll have roughly 8 interviews focused primarily on system design, then behavioral, and then coding.\n\nDepending on the length of the onsite, Netflix recruiting may ask you if you’d prefer to split the onsite over two days, and we recommend that you proactively ask to do that, given how taxing the behavioral and system design portions are!\n\nNetflix is the only FAANG that routinely includes 1-2 directors in their onsite loops. If your loop has two, it’ll be one director will be from your org and another from a partner org. Netflix does this to reduce bias. One director may do a system design interview, and the other will do a behavioral interview.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“Don’t be thrown off by having to talk to directors. Just stick to the principles: when you speak about technical stuff you’ve worked on, focus on scale, availability, and security. When you speak about behavioral stuff: use shared ideas from their culture deck, take accountability for your wins and failures, and demonstrate metrics and impact.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n“The HRBP \\[which is basically a very senior recruiting function\\] and the director would typically focus on behavioral rounds. I have also seen directors spending time (30 mins) just letting candidates ask and clarify any questions that they might have regarding the team, Netflix culture, career growth path or any other aspects. So, a strong recommendation would be to be ready with your genuine questions list and get things clarified in such interviews. Candid conversation is one of the key values at Netflix and asking genuine concerns if any is seen through good lenses, as that establishes candidates' seriousness about the role to some extent.”\n\n## Netflix’s interview types in detail\n\n### Coding\n\nThe technical questions Netflix asks vary from team to team. Some teams don’t ask LeetCode questions. Other teams will ask medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions with a creative/practical twist.\n\nThese rounds are going to change team by team, but the pattern we’ve noticed is that Netflix coding questions often come in two parts.\n\nTypically there is one question and, in scenarios where edge cases and tests are done early, say within 45 minutes, the interviewer may choose to spend some time discussing general large scale engineering concepts and distributed systems (like microservices, scalability, etc.). For instance, some expansions could be:\n\n*   A system design expansion on top of the coding question, such as a practical application where they ask you to apply the solution you just found to a part of their real-life system\n*   A deep dive into a specific skill set (e.g., if this team codes in Java: they’ll have a round all about multithreading for Java specifically)\n*   For everything you need to prepare for Netflix’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Netflix coding interview preparation resources](#netflix-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nThis is the most important round at Netflix. Coding carries the least weight, behavioral carries a lot, and system design has the most.\n\nNetflix system design rounds are highly unique and highly challenging. Netflix is to system design as Google is to coding; these technical interview rounds include the most difficult and bespoke questions.\n\nSimilar to how Amazon loves Leadership Principles, Netflix loves system design so much they even throw it into coding rounds sometimes – first, you solve a LeetCode-style problem. Then they ask you to apply it to a real-world use case.\n\nThat said, Netflix system design rounds are easier to prepare for if you know the patterns: Netflix loves scale. Netflix never wants to go down, and Netflix hates when things aren’t secure. Availability is super important to them; they want to ask and hear about tactics to scale systems, keep systems highly available, and maintain secure systems.\n\nAt Netflix, you’re likely to see unique questions that you won’t get anywhere else, and the system design round is the part of the process that Netflix interviewers take the most pride in, so they make up hard, one-of-a-kind questions from scratch. Thematically, their questions are more likely to be focused on scaling. They also like to ask about security and availability.\n\nIn fact, Netflix is more likely than the rest of FAANG to give you a system design round focused solely on security. For instance, you might get asked what you would do during a DDoS attack, and the entirety of the session will be spent drilling down into the details. And because they’re also obsessed with availability, you might get questions around backups and what to do if a service goes down.\n\nMoreover, as with their coding rounds, Netflix prefers questions with a practical application, and they’re likely to ask you about something they’re working on right now. If you research the hell out of their architecture – specifically the service that particular team is in charge of – and the other services this service interacts with, you’ll be in good shape.\n\nYou’re also likely to see a “reverse system design” round, where your interviewer will ask you pointed questions about the systems you’ve worked on before, e.g., the largest scale system you’ve worked on, how did you manage it, how did you scale it, etc.\n\nQuestions they most likely _won’t_ ask are product-focused questions, such as “Design Spotify”.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nLearn about Netflix’s overall architecture so you can a) speak their language, and b) build or speak of something similar (in the interview) that Netflix has already built but simpler.\n\nFor the team you interview with: what’s their tech stack? What open source stuff do they do? With which other services might their service interact? That last question is most critical. If you can put forethought into how their current system works, you’ll have a huge leg up; then all you’ll need to do is discuss what you learned about their system to score a bunch of points with any of their interviewers.\n\nWhat tooling you use in these interviews depends on the team you’re interviewing with.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nAnswers to behavioral questions are almost as important as system design at Netflix. You’ll get rejected if you fail the behavioral screen.\n\nThese interviews have a heavy emphasis on the candidate being a cultural fit, being able to work in a team, having curiosity, and being product minded, highly motivated individuals capable of driving products forward.\n\nA unique part of Netflix’s behavioral interview is the “Dream Team” interview. This is a slightly more intense behavioral round conducted by a director. The \"volume\" is turned up on all of the things you might see in a typical behavioral round at Netflix (scale, accountability, open communication about concerns, high risk and high reward.)\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n“Netflix doesn’t hire as much as other FAANGs, so they want to make sure you're a star. That’s what the ‘Dream Team’ interview is about.”\n\nOne key thing you need to do before your Netflix behavioral interview is read their culture memo. Our interviewers tell us that if you don’t do this, you will fail the behavioral round.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Engineer\n\n“The culture illustrated in the [culture memo](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) is sort of accurate to how the culture at Netflix actually is, but the actual culture is less intense. Team members tend to get along really well. You don’t compete with others in your performance review like it is at companies like Facebook. We’re not ranked against peers, so people are more willing to help each other out.”\n\nNetflix will ask about impressive things you’ve done, as well as dig into your motivation (your “why”). This round will feel like you’re doing self-promotion. Typical questions will ask about your favorite project, latest project, and most significant project, as well as open-ended questions about what you’re looking for in your next role and why you’re interested in Netflix.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nPromote yourself early and often in Netflix behavioral rounds. Promote yourself proactively. Metrics and impact statements are effective ways to promote yourself because they convey a sense of scale and complexity.\n\nIt can be nerve-wracking to talk to a director for 45-60 minutes. It’s more nerve-wracking when, out the gate, they ask you to describe the biggest thing you’ve ever worked on. When talking to a director, it’s more important to have metrics and impact statements.\n\n## How Netflix makes hiring decisions\n\nNetflix interviewers are untrained, their questions are unstandardized, their interviews are team-dependent, and their decision-making north star is “Why”. You can interview with multiple teams concurrently, effectively giving you multiple shots on goal.\n\nThere’s also no specific company-wide scale for performance at Netflix. This is different from, say, Google, where all candidates are graded on the same “Strong Hire, Hire, Neutral, No Hire, Strong No-Hire” scale. Different teams have different processes, but most decisions are made based on live post-onsite discussions.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n“Netflix hiring decisions are black and white: pass or fail. And then you discuss if you'd be open to changing your mind. The only difference between Apple and Netflix was how they defined cultural fit. Besides that the hiring decisions were made in the same way: informal, mainly based on live discussions, binary decisions, and striving for consensus.”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nImpression management is more powerful at companies that do live feedback discussions. To learn more about impression management, check out the resources to prepare for Netflix later in this section.\n\n## Netflix coding interview preparation resources\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Netflix content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Netflix interviewers, long-form solutions to common Netflix questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Netflix interviews.\n\n### Netflix interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Netflix interviewers on our platform. Watch them so you can learn from others’ mistakes.\n\n[\n\n![Binary array partition](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Netflix_1_39e985ddaa.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nNetflix Interviewer\n\nBinary array partition\n\nHeuristic Panda, a Netflix engineer, interviewed Orange Storm in Python\n\n\n\n](/mocks/netflix-python-binary-array-partition)\n\n[\n\n![Recover binary search tree](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Netflix_2_d55e984f9c.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nNetflix Interviewer\n\nRecover binary search tree\n\nHot Broccoli, a Netflix engineer, interviewed Sterling Daemon in Java\n\n\n\n](/mocks/netflix-java-recover-binary-search-tree)\n\n### Solutions to common Netflix questions\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Netflix ask on our platform.

First, we spoke to a bunch of Netflix interviewers in our community. Then we cross-referenced all the anecdotes we heard with Glassdoor data AND our own data-set of mock interviews in the style of Netflix. Based on all of the above, here are the technical topics you’re likely to encounter:\n\n[System Design](/system-design-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \n& tips](/system-design-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 28  \ninterview replays](/mocks?technical=system-design)\n\n[Trees](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \n& tips](/trees-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \ninterview replays](/mocks?technical=trees)\n\n[Buckets](/buckets-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \n& tips](/buckets-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 3  \ninterview replays](/mocks?technical=buckets)\n\n[Hash Maps](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \ninterview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-maps)\n\n[Matrices](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \n& tips](/matrices-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \ninterview replays](/mocks?technical=matrices)\n\n[Search](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \n& tips](/search-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 7  \ninterview replays](/mocks?technical=search)\n\n[Arrays](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \n& tips](/arrays-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 20  \ninterview replays](/mocks?technical=arrays)\n\n[Hash Tables](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \n& tips](/hash-tables-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 5  \ninterview replays](/mocks?technical=hash-tables)\n\n[Graphs](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \n& tips](/graphs-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 10  \ninterview replays](/mocks?technical=graphs)\n\n[Sorting](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \n& tips](/sorting-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 12  \ninterview replays](/mocks?technical=sorting)\n\n[Memoization](/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Questions  \n& tips](/memoization-interview-questions)\n\n[Watch 4  \ninterview replays](/mocks?technical=memoization)\n\n## Other Netflix interview preparation resources\n\nThe resources listed below are designed to help with various aspects of Netflix interview prep, from technical problem-solving to understanding the company’s core values.\n\n### System design\n\nSince Netflix has the most difficult system design screen (and their version of this round has a lot of overlap with other FAANGs), if you prep for Netflix, you’re also upskilling for system design rounds at all FAANGs. We recommend the following resources to all engineers interviewing at FAANG:\n\n*   [A Senior Engineer's Guide to the System Design Interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n*   Brush up on scaling, security, availability, microservices, and failure recovery/backups\n*   Research the hell out of the technology the team you’re interviewing with makes. Then practice taking a low-level system design question, coming to a quick solution, and then applying it to a piece of the real-world system this specific team works on.\n*   Practice low-level system design questions more than high-level ones.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThese resources will help you “learn their language.” Then, when you communicate with Netflix, speak their language.\n\n*   [Khan Academy’s intro to impression management](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/individuals-and-society/social-interactions/v/impression-management)\n*   [Netflix’s famous culture slide deck](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture)\n*   Watch a few videos on the [YouTube Channel called “WeAreNetflix”](https://www.youtube.com/@WeAreNetflix/videos)\n\nWant to know if you’re ready to interview at Netflix?

Netflix’s interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Netflix’s interview process and questions\n\nNetflix’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call\n*   Hiring manager screen\n*   Technical phone interview\n*   A very long onsite\n\n![Netflix’s interview process: recruiter call, hiring manager screen, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fnetflix-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Netflix’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nEvery human organization views themselves as a metaphor; Netflix doesn’t view themselves as a family like some other tech companies, they view themselves as a high-caliber sports team (in fact, Netflix calls their employees a “dream team”). They explain this metaphor themselves in their infamous culture memo.\n\nFinally, Netflix’s interview process is decentralized and team-dependent. Moreover, you can interview with multiple teams at Netflix concurrently, which can help you increase your odds of securing a job offer.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Hiring manager screen\n\nThis is a 30 minute call. A former Netflix employee called this round “Very chill, especially compared to the onsite.” This round consists of bidirectional surface-level questions.\n\nThe hiring manager will also be selling you on Netflix. Hiring managers doing selling is business as usual, but in this case, it serves an additional purpose – because their onsite is by far the most intense, they have to sell harder upfront because the onsite is a bigger commitment for the candidates.\n\n### Step 3: Technical phone screen\n\nThe Netflix technical phone screen is a coding interview that typically lasts 45-60 minutes. There is significant inter-team variation on what these interviews cover, and the tooling you use during these interviews also varies by team,\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nOnsite interview structure varies from team to team, but you’ll have roughly 8 interviews focused primarily on system design, then behavioral, and then coding.\n\nDepending on the length of the onsite, Netflix recruiting may ask you if you’d prefer to split the onsite over two days, and we recommend that you proactively ask to do that, given how taxing the behavioral and system design portions are!\n\nNetflix is the only FAANG that routinely includes 1-2 directors in their onsite loops. If your loop has two, it’ll be one director will be from your org and another from a partner org. Netflix does this to reduce bias. One director may do a system design interview, and the other will do a behavioral interview.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“Don’t be thrown off by having to talk to directors. Just stick to the principles: when you speak about technical stuff you’ve worked on, focus on scale, availability, and security. When you speak about behavioral stuff: use shared ideas from their culture deck, take accountability for your wins and failures, and demonstrate metrics and impact.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n“The HRBP \\[which is basically a very senior recruiting function\\] and the director would typically focus on behavioral rounds. I have also seen directors spending time (30 mins) just letting candidates ask and clarify any questions that they might have regarding the team, Netflix culture, career growth path or any other aspects. So, a strong recommendation would be to be ready with your genuine questions list and get things clarified in such interviews. Candid conversation is one of the key values at Netflix and asking genuine concerns if any is seen through good lenses, as that establishes candidates' seriousness about the role to some extent.”\n\n## Netflix’s interview types in detail\n\n### Coding\n\nThe technical questions Netflix asks vary from team to team. Some teams don’t ask LeetCode questions. Other teams will ask medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions with a creative/practical twist.\n\nThese rounds are going to change team by team, but the pattern we’ve noticed is that Netflix coding questions often come in two parts.\n\nTypically there is one question and, in scenarios where edge cases and tests are done early, say within 45 minutes, the interviewer may choose to spend some time discussing general large scale engineering concepts and distributed systems (like microservices, scalability, etc.). For instance, some expansions could be:\n\n*   A system design expansion on top of the coding question, such as a practical application where they ask you to apply the solution you just found to a part of their real-life system\n*   A deep dive into a specific skill set (e.g., if this team codes in Java: they’ll have a round all about multithreading for Java specifically)\n*   For everything you need to prepare for Netflix’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Netflix coding interview preparation resources](#netflix-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nThis is the most important round at Netflix. Coding carries the least weight, behavioral carries a lot, and system design has the most.\n\nNetflix system design rounds are highly unique and highly challenging. Netflix is to system design as Google is to coding; these technical interview rounds include the most difficult and bespoke questions.\n\nSimilar to how Amazon loves Leadership Principles, Netflix loves system design so much they even throw it into coding rounds sometimes – first, you solve a LeetCode-style problem. Then they ask you to apply it to a real-world use case.\n\nThat said, Netflix system design rounds are easier to prepare for if you know the patterns: Netflix loves scale. Netflix never wants to go down, and Netflix hates when things aren’t secure. Availability is super important to them; they want to ask and hear about tactics to scale systems, keep systems highly available, and maintain secure systems.\n\nAt Netflix, you’re likely to see unique questions that you won’t get anywhere else, and the system design round is the part of the process that Netflix interviewers take the most pride in, so they make up hard, one-of-a-kind questions from scratch. Thematically, their questions are more likely to be focused on scaling. They also like to ask about security and availability.\n\nIn fact, Netflix is more likely than the rest of FAANG to give you a system design round focused solely on security. For instance, you might get asked what you would do during a DDoS attack, and the entirety of the session will be spent drilling down into the details. And because they’re also obsessed with availability, you might get questions around backups and what to do if a service goes down.\n\nMoreover, as with their coding rounds, Netflix prefers questions with a practical application, and they’re likely to ask you about something they’re working on right now. If you research the hell out of their architecture – specifically the service that particular team is in charge of – and the other services this service interacts with, you’ll be in good shape.\n\nYou’re also likely to see a “reverse system design” round, where your interviewer will ask you pointed questions about the systems you’ve worked on before, e.g., the largest scale system you’ve worked on, how did you manage it, how did you scale it, etc.\n\nQuestions they most likely _won’t_ ask are product-focused questions, such as “Design Spotify”.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nLearn about Netflix’s overall architecture so you can a) speak their language, and b) build or speak of something similar (in the interview) that Netflix has already built but simpler.\n\nFor the team you interview with: what’s their tech stack? What open source stuff do they do? With which other services might their service interact? That last question is most critical. If you can put forethought into how their current system works, you’ll have a huge leg up; then all you’ll need to do is discuss what you learned about their system to score a bunch of points with any of their interviewers.\n\nWhat tooling you use in these interviews depends on the team you’re interviewing with.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nAnswers to behavioral questions are almost as important as system design at Netflix. You’ll get rejected if you fail the behavioral screen.\n\nThese interviews have a heavy emphasis on the candidate being a cultural fit, being able to work in a team, having curiosity, and being product minded, highly motivated individuals capable of driving products forward.\n\nA unique part of Netflix’s behavioral interview is the “Dream Team” interview. This is a slightly more intense behavioral round conducted by a director. The \"volume\" is turned up on all of the things you might see in a typical behavioral round at Netflix (scale, accountability, open communication about concerns, high risk and high reward.)\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n“Netflix doesn’t hire as much as other FAANGs, so they want to make sure you're a star. That’s what the ‘Dream Team’ interview is about.”\n\nOne key thing you need to do before your Netflix behavioral interview is read their culture memo. Our interviewers tell us that if you don’t do this, you will fail the behavioral round.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Engineer\n\n“The culture illustrated in the [culture memo](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) is sort of accurate to how the culture at Netflix actually is, but the actual culture is less intense. Team members tend to get along really well. You don’t compete with others in your performance review like it is at companies like Facebook. We’re not ranked against peers, so people are more willing to help each other out.”\n\nNetflix will ask about impressive things you’ve done, as well as dig into your motivation (your “why”). This round will feel like you’re doing self-promotion. Typical questions will ask about your favorite project, latest project, and most significant project, as well as open-ended questions about what you’re looking for in your next role and why you’re interested in Netflix.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nPromote yourself early and often in Netflix behavioral rounds. Promote yourself proactively. Metrics and impact statements are effective ways to promote yourself because they convey a sense of scale and complexity.\n\nIt can be nerve-wracking to talk to a director for 45-60 minutes. It’s more nerve-wracking when, out the gate, they ask you to describe the biggest thing you’ve ever worked on. When talking to a director, it’s more important to have metrics and impact statements.\n\n## How Netflix makes hiring decisions\n\nNetflix interviewers are untrained, their questions are unstandardized, their interviews are team-dependent, and their decision-making north star is “Why”. You can interview with multiple teams concurrently, effectively giving you multiple shots on goal.\n\nThere’s also no specific company-wide scale for performance at Netflix. This is different from, say, Google, where all candidates are graded on the same “Strong Hire, Hire, Neutral, No Hire, Strong No-Hire” scale. Different teams have different processes, but most decisions are made based on live post-onsite discussions.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n“Netflix hiring decisions are black and white: pass or fail. And then you discuss if you'd be open to changing your mind. The only difference between Apple and Netflix was how they defined cultural fit. Besides that the hiring decisions were made in the same way: informal, mainly based on live discussions, binary decisions, and striving for consensus.”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nImpression management is more powerful at companies that do live feedback discussions. To learn more about impression management, check out the resources to prepare for Netflix later in this section.\n\n## Netflix coding interview preparation resources\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Netflix content for you!

Then practice taking a low-level system design question, coming to a quick solution, and then applying it to a piece of the real-world system this specific team works on.\n*   Practice low-level system design questions more than high-level ones.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nThese resources will help you “learn their language.” Then, when you communicate with Netflix, speak their language.\n\n*   [Khan Academy’s intro to impression management](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/individuals-and-society/social-interactions/v/impression-management)\n*   [Netflix’s famous culture slide deck](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture)\n*   Watch a few videos on the [YouTube Channel called “WeAreNetflix”](https://www.youtube.com/@WeAreNetflix/videos)\n\nWant to know if you’re ready to interview at Netflix?

Netflix’s interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Netflix’s interview process and questions\n\nNetflix’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call\n*   Hiring manager screen\n*   Technical phone interview\n*   A very long onsite\n\n![Netflix’s interview process: recruiter call, hiring manager screen, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fnetflix-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Netflix’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers.\n\nEvery human organization views themselves as a metaphor; Netflix doesn’t view themselves as a family like some other tech companies, they view themselves as a high-caliber sports team (in fact, Netflix calls their employees a “dream team”). They explain this metaphor themselves in their infamous culture memo.\n\nFinally, Netflix’s interview process is decentralized and team-dependent. Moreover, you can interview with multiple teams at Netflix concurrently, which can help you increase your odds of securing a job offer.\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls)\n\n### Step 2: Hiring manager screen\n\nThis is a 30 minute call. A former Netflix employee called this round “Very chill, especially compared to the onsite.” This round consists of bidirectional surface-level questions.\n\nThe hiring manager will also be selling you on Netflix. Hiring managers doing selling is business as usual, but in this case, it serves an additional purpose – because their onsite is by far the most intense, they have to sell harder upfront because the onsite is a bigger commitment for the candidates.\n\n### Step 3: Technical phone screen\n\nThe Netflix technical phone screen is a coding interview that typically lasts 45-60 minutes. There is significant inter-team variation on what these interviews cover, and the tooling you use during these interviews also varies by team,\n\n### Step 4: Onsite\n\nOnsite interview structure varies from team to team, but you’ll have roughly 8 interviews focused primarily on system design, then behavioral, and then coding.\n\nDepending on the length of the onsite, Netflix recruiting may ask you if you’d prefer to split the onsite over two days, and we recommend that you proactively ask to do that, given how taxing the behavioral and system design portions are!\n\nNetflix is the only FAANG that routinely includes 1-2 directors in their onsite loops. If your loop has two, it’ll be one director will be from your org and another from a partner org. Netflix does this to reduce bias. One director may do a system design interview, and the other will do a behavioral interview.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“Don’t be thrown off by having to talk to directors. Just stick to the principles: when you speak about technical stuff you’ve worked on, focus on scale, availability, and security. When you speak about behavioral stuff: use shared ideas from their culture deck, take accountability for your wins and failures, and demonstrate metrics and impact.”\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n“The HRBP \\[which is basically a very senior recruiting function\\] and the director would typically focus on behavioral rounds. I have also seen directors spending time (30 mins) just letting candidates ask and clarify any questions that they might have regarding the team, Netflix culture, career growth path or any other aspects. So, a strong recommendation would be to be ready with your genuine questions list and get things clarified in such interviews. Candid conversation is one of the key values at Netflix and asking genuine concerns if any is seen through good lenses, as that establishes candidates' seriousness about the role to some extent.”\n\n## Netflix’s interview types in detail\n\n### Coding\n\nThe technical questions Netflix asks vary from team to team. Some teams don’t ask LeetCode questions. Other teams will ask medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions with a creative/practical twist.\n\nThese rounds are going to change team by team, but the pattern we’ve noticed is that Netflix coding questions often come in two parts.\n\nTypically there is one question and, in scenarios where edge cases and tests are done early, say within 45 minutes, the interviewer may choose to spend some time discussing general large scale engineering concepts and distributed systems (like microservices, scalability, etc.). For instance, some expansions could be:\n\n*   A system design expansion on top of the coding question, such as a practical application where they ask you to apply the solution you just found to a part of their real-life system\n*   A deep dive into a specific skill set (e.g., if this team codes in Java: they’ll have a round all about multithreading for Java specifically)\n*   For everything you need to prepare for Netflix’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Netflix coding interview preparation resources](#netflix-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nThis is the most important round at Netflix. Coding carries the least weight, behavioral carries a lot, and system design has the most.\n\nNetflix system design rounds are highly unique and highly challenging. Netflix is to system design as Google is to coding; these technical interview rounds include the most difficult and bespoke questions.\n\nSimilar to how Amazon loves Leadership Principles, Netflix loves system design so much they even throw it into coding rounds sometimes – first, you solve a LeetCode-style problem. Then they ask you to apply it to a real-world use case.\n\nThat said, Netflix system design rounds are easier to prepare for if you know the patterns: Netflix loves scale. Netflix never wants to go down, and Netflix hates when things aren’t secure. Availability is super important to them; they want to ask and hear about tactics to scale systems, keep systems highly available, and maintain secure systems.\n\nAt Netflix, you’re likely to see unique questions that you won’t get anywhere else, and the system design round is the part of the process that Netflix interviewers take the most pride in, so they make up hard, one-of-a-kind questions from scratch. Thematically, their questions are more likely to be focused on scaling. They also like to ask about security and availability.\n\nIn fact, Netflix is more likely than the rest of FAANG to give you a system design round focused solely on security. For instance, you might get asked what you would do during a DDoS attack, and the entirety of the session will be spent drilling down into the details. And because they’re also obsessed with availability, you might get questions around backups and what to do if a service goes down.\n\nMoreover, as with their coding rounds, Netflix prefers questions with a practical application, and they’re likely to ask you about something they’re working on right now. If you research the hell out of their architecture – specifically the service that particular team is in charge of – and the other services this service interacts with, you’ll be in good shape.\n\nYou’re also likely to see a “reverse system design” round, where your interviewer will ask you pointed questions about the systems you’ve worked on before, e.g., the largest scale system you’ve worked on, how did you manage it, how did you scale it, etc.\n\nQuestions they most likely _won’t_ ask are product-focused questions, such as “Design Spotify”.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nLearn about Netflix’s overall architecture so you can a) speak their language, and b) build or speak of something similar (in the interview) that Netflix has already built but simpler.\n\nFor the team you interview with: what’s their tech stack? What open source stuff do they do? With which other services might their service interact? That last question is most critical. If you can put forethought into how their current system works, you’ll have a huge leg up; then all you’ll need to do is discuss what you learned about their system to score a bunch of points with any of their interviewers.\n\nWhat tooling you use in these interviews depends on the team you’re interviewing with.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nAnswers to behavioral questions are almost as important as system design at Netflix. You’ll get rejected if you fail the behavioral screen.\n\nThese interviews have a heavy emphasis on the candidate being a cultural fit, being able to work in a team, having curiosity, and being product minded, highly motivated individuals capable of driving products forward.\n\nA unique part of Netflix’s behavioral interview is the “Dream Team” interview. This is a slightly more intense behavioral round conducted by a director. The \"volume\" is turned up on all of the things you might see in a typical behavioral round at Netflix (scale, accountability, open communication about concerns, high risk and high reward.)\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n“Netflix doesn’t hire as much as other FAANGs, so they want to make sure you're a star. That’s what the ‘Dream Team’ interview is about.”\n\nOne key thing you need to do before your Netflix behavioral interview is read their culture memo. Our interviewers tell us that if you don’t do this, you will fail the behavioral round.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Engineer\n\n“The culture illustrated in the [culture memo](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) is sort of accurate to how the culture at Netflix actually is, but the actual culture is less intense. Team members tend to get along really well. You don’t compete with others in your performance review like it is at companies like Facebook. We’re not ranked against peers, so people are more willing to help each other out.”\n\nNetflix will ask about impressive things you’ve done, as well as dig into your motivation (your “why”). This round will feel like you’re doing self-promotion. Typical questions will ask about your favorite project, latest project, and most significant project, as well as open-ended questions about what you’re looking for in your next role and why you’re interested in Netflix.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nPromote yourself early and often in Netflix behavioral rounds. Promote yourself proactively. Metrics and impact statements are effective ways to promote yourself because they convey a sense of scale and complexity.\n\nIt can be nerve-wracking to talk to a director for 45-60 minutes. It’s more nerve-wracking when, out the gate, they ask you to describe the biggest thing you’ve ever worked on. When talking to a director, it’s more important to have metrics and impact statements.\n\n## How Netflix makes hiring decisions\n\nNetflix interviewers are untrained, their questions are unstandardized, their interviews are team-dependent, and their decision-making north star is “Why”. You can interview with multiple teams concurrently, effectively giving you multiple shots on goal.\n\nThere’s also no specific company-wide scale for performance at Netflix. This is different from, say, Google, where all candidates are graded on the same “Strong Hire, Hire, Neutral, No Hire, Strong No-Hire” scale. Different teams have different processes, but most decisions are made based on live post-onsite discussions.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer\n\n“Netflix hiring decisions are black and white: pass or fail. And then you discuss if you'd be open to changing your mind. The only difference between Apple and Netflix was how they defined cultural fit. Besides that the hiring decisions were made in the same way: informal, mainly based on live discussions, binary decisions, and striving for consensus.”\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nImpression management is more powerful at companies that do live feedback discussions. To learn more about impression management, check out the resources to prepare for Netflix later in this section.\n\n## Netflix coding interview preparation resources\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Netflix content for you!

Apple's interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Apple's interview process and questions\n\nApple’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call OR online assessment\n*   Technical phone screen (if you didn’t do the online assessment)\n*   Onsite interview\n\n![Apple’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fapple-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Apple’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interview experience.\n\nHumans in groups act out a chosen metaphor; Apple isn’t a sports team. They’re an army. Their army is made up of people obsessed with making great products. And they look to hire people who’ve embedded Apple products into their lives. Armies reward loyalty more than sports teams. Apple also has the longest tenured employees in FAANG (we're including Microsoft with FAANG for the purposes of this guide).\n\nApple is decentralized and lets candidates interview with different teams concurrently; if you want to maximize your odds interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I interviewed with like 12 teams. I got 2 offers. Along the way, I told one of the Apple recruiter’s I was interviewing for another Apple team and they shrugged it off; they didn’t care.”\n\nApple’s interview process is more like what you might see at a startup than any other FAANG – from assigning which questions to ask to interviewer training to how hiring decisions get made. Significant inter-team variance is the norm, with each team essentially acting like a startup that’s coming up with its own way of conducting interviews.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\nAt Apple, there’s no formal interviewer training. It’s very ad hoc. Every team is different. There is literally no process. What each of the teams does is rely on one of their very senior engineers or someone very experienced. Apple has a lot of people with long tenures, like 15 years. One of my colleagues had been there for 22 years. At Apple, the more senior you get the more the team trusts you to come up with your own questions. So what the interviewers at Apple typically do: you come up with a question that's not online, and you make sure it’s relevant to what your team is doing. Then you pitch it to your manager or tech lead. Then you run with it.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“One thing not enough candidates know about is this: there’s no such thing as an Apple interview. You apply for a team. Not the company. When people ask me “How to prepare for an Apple interview?” I say ask the recruiter. Because they usually know what types of questions are asked. The recruiter spends 30 minutes or an hour per debrief where engineers are talking about the details about the code. So if the recruiter is paying attention or is at least a little bit technical, they should have a clue whether it’s LeetCode-style questions or embedded style questions. So ask your Apple recruiter a forced-choice question like, ‘Is this interview more X or more Y?’”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I was one of the people to come up with a take-home assignment for candidates. Which was my favorite part of the process at Apple. We were hiring people for full-stack but not just any full-stack – we wanted people who were coding in Python on the back-end and a particular framework on the front-end. We cooked up a take-home which was a scaled down version of what they’d be doing on the job: an internal tool built in those exact technologies. We gave them that take home and had them work on it for a week. Then we discussed it at the onsite where we’d live-debug it and talk about architecture. I really liked this ‘Try before you buy’ style process. Because Apple really wants you to be productive in week 2, if not at the end of week 1.”\n\nApple is the most likely to shock you; they’re more likely to ask you something you didn’t prepare for. Out of all the FAANGs, they’re the ones you can expect to do something unexpected, and some of their tactics can seem mercenary. Apple is the only FAANG which sometimes has a process to cut interviews short if the candidate clearly isn’t meeting the bar – if you don't perform above the bar for the first half of the interview, they’ll cancel the rest.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“If by the fourth round, the hiring manager has gotten consistent feedback that doesn’t meet the bar, then they’d end the onsite early and reject the candidate.”\n\nApple is not results or process oriented. They’re motivation oriented. In other words, they care more about the “Why” than the “What” or the “How”, and as such, they value behavioral interviews more than coding.\n\nApple employees are obsessed with privacy. It’s not just marketing lip service. When asked if “privacy” is a buzzword at Apple, our interviewers said…\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Privacy isn't just a buzzword. We are obsessed with it. To drive that part home. Because it’s so important. And as I mentioned, I was a part of a group focused on gathering user data - users here being Apple internal employees – to inform future products.\n\nEven at Apple, when we’re just getting data from internal employees, we anonymized the data. Just to practice what we preach. Privacy is huge. Another example to illustrate that is that people get fired for torrenting music.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Unless you’re interviewing for a security role, very rarely. Technical people at Apple are hired to do what they do best. They have a whole army of compliance folks and lawyers to take care of that stuff. They also have an internal police force called “InfoSec”, which is the team which takes care of the secrecy stuff. Engineers are needed to do what they were hired to do: engineering.”\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls) for what to expect. We do encourage you to ask your recruiter what to expect for the rest of the process because as you’ll see, there is a lot of variance from team to team.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“Ask your Apple recruiter forced choice questions with two options, such as, ‘Is this coding round more of a typical LeetCode round, or more of a domain-specific open ended deep dive into a specific technology?’”\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone interview\n\nLike everything else at Apple, the format and technical questions presented in Apple phone screens can vary a ton. Verify this by asking your recruiter!\n\nTechnical phone screens are coding interviews that range from 30 minutes to an hour. This tech interview may be between you and a single interviewer or sometimes a panel of interviewers. It may even be a hiring manager screen with a mix of behavioral questions and coding.\n\nIn any case, the general format is a shared coding environment where the interviewer(s) can assess your ability to utilize basic data structures and algorithms concepts. Being able to provide a solution for coding questions and quickly analyze the runtime complexity of your solution are key skills to have going into this interview.\n\nThe tooling used in Apple’s technical interview rounds depends on the team you’re interviewing with, but we’ve heard that some teams use CoderPad.\n\n### (In some cases) Step 2.5: Take-home assignment\n\nSome teams give candidates a take-home assignment. They can give this around the same time they schedule a phone screen. The hiring manager is usually the person to decide whether or not candidates get one.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThere will be roughly six to eight in-person rounds of interviews, each of which will be with your future teammates. Each round will have least one, or possibly two, interviewers.\n\nNote that an onsite loop with one team at Apple will look very different than an onsite loop with another.\n\n## Apple’s interview types in detail\n\nInterviewers can ask whatever behavioral, coding, or system design questions they want; there is no standardization for Apple interview questions. However, before an interview loop takes place, some teams will do a quick, informal assignment of what kinds of questions each interviewer is supposed to ask so that they don’t all end up asking the same things.\n\nMoreover, Apple interviewers are untrained, and as soon as a senior engineer is hired they can start conducting interviews.\n\nApple’s unpredictable nature makes it so some of their interview rounds can’t be categorized into behavioral, coding, or system design. Is a philosophical question about products a behavioral question? Not really. But they might ask one in a behavioral round. Are rapid fire infrastructure-focused open-ended trivia questions more system design or coding? It depends.\n\nFor example, here’s how one Apple interviewer describes the behind-the-scenes top-down directive before an upcoming onsite. “Go find a question that would be a good one to ask for our team.” That interviewer then ran it up the chain to an engineer above them. Then, that question immediately got asked in the next interview.\n\nAt Apple, each interview loop is specific to the needs of individual hiring managers – there is no canonical “Apple interview”, and everything is “made to order” for each specific team. That makes it difficult for candidates to prepare.\n\n### Coding\n\nSome teams at Apple prefer practical rounds. Sometimes, they’ll have you write a program on your own laptop and IDE. Other times, they’ll spend the whole round deep diving into a specific technology/use case that’s relevant for their team. For example, a team that wrote in Java and did a lot of work with concurrency had a whole round focused on concurrency in Java!\n\nOther teams do medium-ish LeetCode-style questions.\n\nAt the end of the day, these interviews vary so widely it’s hard to give a specific directive, other than: ask your recruiter. For senior and above candidates, it’s more about demonstrating competence rather than needing to ace the question.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Apple’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Apple coding interview preparation resources](#apple-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nApple interviewers tend to ask questions relevant to a specific team’s work. For instance, a team focused on building web services will tend to ask questions about that, while front-end teams may ask UI-related questions. It may be good to try to get a feel for the day-to-day work from the recruiter/hiring manager, as the job descriptions are not always the most helpful (remember: privacy!).\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIn system design rounds, Apple interviewers love to hear about reliability. If you don’t know what else to talk about, dig into reliability.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nApple’s most important round is usually behavioral or system design. Behavioral rounds are more important than coding rounds.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“In behavioral, you gotta be a rockstar. You gotta be a leader. If you’re abrasive, or if you’re not a cultural fit, how are you going to lead the juniors? And system design is going to weigh a little more than behavioral. If you can’t code or if you’re a little rusty –if you’re good at system design and behavioral–we’ll forgive the subpar coding rounds.”\n\nAn interesting paradox at Apple is: they highly value behavioral rounds but they don’t have a standardized way to assess candidates in those interviews\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Towards the end of my career at Apple, we had a huge need for mobile developers. People who were able to do iOS apps. I was part of an R&D team. We mainly built web products in the beginning, but towards the end of my career we started doing more mobile stuff. We didn't want to hire someone who could only do mobile. We wanted someone who would be half as good at mobile stuff and half as good at web stuff, so they could plug themselves in anywhere.\n\nIf the interview process was standardized across the whole company - you can imagine how hard that would be to test specifically for the niche skill set we needed. Within two days we cooked up a whole new homework assignment just for the ios candidates, we cooked up a whole new set of interview questions. We kept the behavioral part the same. But the technical part - we flipped it over just like that. And it was really good. We changed the way we graded, we were able to filter candidates based on the new set of questions. It was just fast. We didn't get any pushback from HR. We didn't have to work with compliance. We just did it. Really fast. Really nimble.”\n\nBecause Apple doesn’t standardize their interviews, they’re particularly prone to bias. Sometimes the top down guidance to Apple interviewers is something like: “In the behavioral round, just see if you like them. See if you’d like to get a beer with them.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“\\[Interviews are never standardized.\\] And i’ll tell you why. Apple is a very secretive company. Everything is on a need to know basis. Also, it's a hugely political place. It was good for me because I understood the game. I didn’t blame the players I played the game. For those who understand the intricacies of politics, and simply accept the fact that it will happen when you have all Type-A people being paid a tremendous amount of money to do shitty little things, it's bound to happen. You have to accept it or you’re not going to play the game. Everything at Apple is very siloed. Even when it comes down to the cost center. Everything is super independent of one another. That's actually one of the strengths and weaknesses of Apple. We double effort for sure. But that doesn't matter to Tim Cook. They have billions of dollars to afford this – not a problem. I also really liked how it was siloed because teams and their priorities change, leadership changes, a lot of things change. Being able to decouple from the greater company enabled them to become one of the biggest, if not the biggest tech company in the world.”\n\nEven if rounds aren’t standardized, you will definitely be asked “Why Apple?”, and your answer needs to be on point. Some interviewers reject candidates solely for not having a good answer to this question. “Why Apple?” isn’t always a single question; they can spread this out into multiple questions and drill down on this for a good portion of a behavioral round. You can also expect other motivation-based (or “why”) questions.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“A common red flag is giving generic answers to the ‘Why Apple?’ questions. If I didn't feel their passion or if they’re just treating Apple as another job, that’s usually a red flag for me regardless of their technical competence. They really have to somehow convince me – and this is an emotional response they have to bring out of me – they really have to convince me they really want to work at Apple, they really want to roll up their sleeves, and they really believe in our values: delighting the customer, sweating the details. Making awesome products… We only care about that. We don't care about anything else. That emotional response has to be drawn from me and if they don’t then I’m likely to say, ‘They were good but meh.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I can tell you about a great answer one candidate had for ‘Why Apple?”. He said something like… His wife and him were university students dating across two continents. This person said they shared a recent feature – I think it was like when you facetime and you can watch video in sync – he shared how that changed his life. His wife and him went through the whole international relationship because of that. That significantly helped their relationship.”\n\nApple wants to hire candidates whose lives have integrated with the Apple products. And the reverse is true too. It's a fatal flaw to say, “I've never used an iPhone or a Macbook or an iPad” because those people clearly haven’t integrated Apple products deeply in their lives.\n\nApple knows what they like, and they like their products! That doesn’t mean all you have to do is gush about the products to pass the behavioral round. It means you have to tell a genuine story which connects you and Apple products or services. Ideally, a story they will remember.\n\nAnother behavioral factor debated among Apple interviewers is whether or not they agree with the idea that Apple is “cult-ish.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Apple cares most about the ‘Why’. You see that rooted deeply in every apple person's DNA. ‘Why Apple?’ Right? I guess this is where people get this notion of Apple being a ‘cult-ish’ company. Much like Tesla, actually. They have a huge customer following, but you also see the same pattern with their employees. Actually, I totally subscribe to this ideology. Because you want a person you work with day in and day out to have that same passion. Sometimes you're going to have to work overtime. You're not going to get paid extra for that. Sometimes you're going to work weekends. Sometimes shit’s gonna hit the fan. You don't want to work with someone who whines about it.\n\nOur theory is that Apple is more likely to reward employees (and candidates) who act like the leader. [If you listen to 1:00:36 - 1:02:05 in an interview with Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5f8bqYYwps&t=3636), you’ll see some stark similarities to how Apple interviewers talk about the organization. In this clip, he says, “You know how many committees we have? None. We are organized like a startup.” He then describes the benefits of silos and dividing things up.\n\nPrivacy and politics are the natural consequence of a place intentionally designed to be siloed and divided up and kept separate. It’s a cost that Apple accepts because the gain is increased productivity. Put people in closed systems (teams and orgs that don’t talk to other teams and orgs) and watch them get more done. This system works like blinders on a racehorse: it keeps vision focused down the track, on the goal, minimizing peripheral distraction. That’s all they need to see and they run/work faster because of it.\n\nOne final aspect of Apple’s behavioral rounds is that they will ask you specific questions about relevant skills. For example, if a team works with big data, they will ask specifically about a time you have worked with large-scale distributed systems in the context of your answer. If you don’t have direct experience with the field, they will try to get as close as possible, like asking you for what tradeoffs you’ve made when choosing a storage system. These behavioral interview questions serve two purposes: showing you have had relevant experience in the context of what the team is hiring for and trying to get you to talk about a particular behavioral skill (e.g., leadership, conflict resolution).\n\n## How Apple makes hiring decisions\n\nAs evidenced by the highest chaos score, Apple doesn’t do many things in hiring consistently, across the whole company. One trend is that Apple teams rely on post-interview live discussions to make hiring decisions. This varies from somewhat informal (compared to the rest of FAANG) to laughably informal.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Post-onsite feedback for my org was 100% live discussions. At Apple I never had to write feedback. Which made me do more interviews. We made the decision on the same day. Everyone had to make a decision at the end of the day. Do an onsite, then at 5pm, we gather in a single meeting room, we do on the count of three: thumbs up, down, or in the middle. Then we talk after seeing the thumbs. And try to convince the people on the other side. If there’s less than 5 thumbs-up, then that might be an instant rejection. If there’s 6 or 7 or more thumbs up, the ‘thumbs up’ people try to convince the other side. Or in that same situation, the 3 or 4 thumbs down will try to convince the other side.”\n\nBecause of the informal decision-making process and reliance on live discussion, managing the impressions of your interviewers is more important at Apple than at other FAANG. In these decision-making meetings, if there’s dissent, they strive for consensus. The people on one side try to convince the other side. This process can last 15-30 minutes on average; all FAANG companies say interviewers fight for candidates, but Apple tends to fight more than most of them.\n\nBecause of their patterns of live-discussions and striving for consensus, Apple interviewers are more likely to fight for or against you (if your performance was on the fence) than any other FAANG, except _maybe_ Netflix.\n\nUltimately, the hiring manager for that particular role has the most say, which means that that’s the person you should be working to impress the most.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“My manager wanted to hire this person. But he failed my interview so badly. I didn't want to argue with my manager but at the same time I didn't want to work with this person. Because we are hiring people we’d work with on a daily basis. So arguments happen a lot. And in this case, I was the only ‘no’ on the board and the candidate got rejected.”\n\n## Apple coding interview preparation resources\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Apple content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Apple interviewers, long-form solutions to common Apple questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Apple interviews.\n\n### Apple interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Apple interviewers on our platform. Watch them so you can learn from others’ mistakes.\n\n[\n\n![Count islands](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Apple_1_6c776505f6.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nApple Interviewer\n\nCount islands\n\nGeneral Avenger, an Apple engineer, interviewed Phantom Dragon in Python\n\n\n\n](/mocks/apple-python-count-islands)\n\n[\n\n![Longest increasing path](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FPython_Apple_3_aa806e9217.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nApple Interviewer\n\nLongest increasing path\n\nMutable Alligator, an Apple engineer, interviewed Swift Pigeon in Python\n\n\n\n](/mocks/apple-python-longest-increasing-path)\n\n[\n\n![Max contiguous subarray](https://interviewing.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2FJava_Apple_2_4a5c5f44e5.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nApple Interviewer\n\nMax contiguous subarray\n\nMutable Alligator, an Apple engineer, interviewed Steampunk Dolphin in Java\n\n\n\n](/mocks/apple-java-max-contiguous-subarray)\n\n### Solutions to common Apple questions\n\nBelow are common questions that interviewers from Apple ask on our platform.

Apple's interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Apple's interview process and questions\n\nApple’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call OR online assessment\n*   Technical phone screen (if you didn’t do the online assessment)\n*   Onsite interview\n\n![Apple’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fapple-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Apple’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interview experience.\n\nHumans in groups act out a chosen metaphor; Apple isn’t a sports team. They’re an army. Their army is made up of people obsessed with making great products. And they look to hire people who’ve embedded Apple products into their lives. Armies reward loyalty more than sports teams. Apple also has the longest tenured employees in FAANG (we're including Microsoft with FAANG for the purposes of this guide).\n\nApple is decentralized and lets candidates interview with different teams concurrently; if you want to maximize your odds interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I interviewed with like 12 teams. I got 2 offers. Along the way, I told one of the Apple recruiter’s I was interviewing for another Apple team and they shrugged it off; they didn’t care.”\n\nApple’s interview process is more like what you might see at a startup than any other FAANG – from assigning which questions to ask to interviewer training to how hiring decisions get made. Significant inter-team variance is the norm, with each team essentially acting like a startup that’s coming up with its own way of conducting interviews.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\nAt Apple, there’s no formal interviewer training. It’s very ad hoc. Every team is different. There is literally no process. What each of the teams does is rely on one of their very senior engineers or someone very experienced. Apple has a lot of people with long tenures, like 15 years. One of my colleagues had been there for 22 years. At Apple, the more senior you get the more the team trusts you to come up with your own questions. So what the interviewers at Apple typically do: you come up with a question that's not online, and you make sure it’s relevant to what your team is doing. Then you pitch it to your manager or tech lead. Then you run with it.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“One thing not enough candidates know about is this: there’s no such thing as an Apple interview. You apply for a team. Not the company. When people ask me “How to prepare for an Apple interview?” I say ask the recruiter. Because they usually know what types of questions are asked. The recruiter spends 30 minutes or an hour per debrief where engineers are talking about the details about the code. So if the recruiter is paying attention or is at least a little bit technical, they should have a clue whether it’s LeetCode-style questions or embedded style questions. So ask your Apple recruiter a forced-choice question like, ‘Is this interview more X or more Y?’”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I was one of the people to come up with a take-home assignment for candidates. Which was my favorite part of the process at Apple. We were hiring people for full-stack but not just any full-stack – we wanted people who were coding in Python on the back-end and a particular framework on the front-end. We cooked up a take-home which was a scaled down version of what they’d be doing on the job: an internal tool built in those exact technologies. We gave them that take home and had them work on it for a week. Then we discussed it at the onsite where we’d live-debug it and talk about architecture. I really liked this ‘Try before you buy’ style process. Because Apple really wants you to be productive in week 2, if not at the end of week 1.”\n\nApple is the most likely to shock you; they’re more likely to ask you something you didn’t prepare for. Out of all the FAANGs, they’re the ones you can expect to do something unexpected, and some of their tactics can seem mercenary. Apple is the only FAANG which sometimes has a process to cut interviews short if the candidate clearly isn’t meeting the bar – if you don't perform above the bar for the first half of the interview, they’ll cancel the rest.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“If by the fourth round, the hiring manager has gotten consistent feedback that doesn’t meet the bar, then they’d end the onsite early and reject the candidate.”\n\nApple is not results or process oriented. They’re motivation oriented. In other words, they care more about the “Why” than the “What” or the “How”, and as such, they value behavioral interviews more than coding.\n\nApple employees are obsessed with privacy. It’s not just marketing lip service. When asked if “privacy” is a buzzword at Apple, our interviewers said…\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Privacy isn't just a buzzword. We are obsessed with it. To drive that part home. Because it’s so important. And as I mentioned, I was a part of a group focused on gathering user data - users here being Apple internal employees – to inform future products.\n\nEven at Apple, when we’re just getting data from internal employees, we anonymized the data. Just to practice what we preach. Privacy is huge. Another example to illustrate that is that people get fired for torrenting music.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Unless you’re interviewing for a security role, very rarely. Technical people at Apple are hired to do what they do best. They have a whole army of compliance folks and lawyers to take care of that stuff. They also have an internal police force called “InfoSec”, which is the team which takes care of the secrecy stuff. Engineers are needed to do what they were hired to do: engineering.”\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls) for what to expect. We do encourage you to ask your recruiter what to expect for the rest of the process because as you’ll see, there is a lot of variance from team to team.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“Ask your Apple recruiter forced choice questions with two options, such as, ‘Is this coding round more of a typical LeetCode round, or more of a domain-specific open ended deep dive into a specific technology?’”\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone interview\n\nLike everything else at Apple, the format and technical questions presented in Apple phone screens can vary a ton. Verify this by asking your recruiter!\n\nTechnical phone screens are coding interviews that range from 30 minutes to an hour. This tech interview may be between you and a single interviewer or sometimes a panel of interviewers. It may even be a hiring manager screen with a mix of behavioral questions and coding.\n\nIn any case, the general format is a shared coding environment where the interviewer(s) can assess your ability to utilize basic data structures and algorithms concepts. Being able to provide a solution for coding questions and quickly analyze the runtime complexity of your solution are key skills to have going into this interview.\n\nThe tooling used in Apple’s technical interview rounds depends on the team you’re interviewing with, but we’ve heard that some teams use CoderPad.\n\n### (In some cases) Step 2.5: Take-home assignment\n\nSome teams give candidates a take-home assignment. They can give this around the same time they schedule a phone screen. The hiring manager is usually the person to decide whether or not candidates get one.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThere will be roughly six to eight in-person rounds of interviews, each of which will be with your future teammates. Each round will have least one, or possibly two, interviewers.\n\nNote that an onsite loop with one team at Apple will look very different than an onsite loop with another.\n\n## Apple’s interview types in detail\n\nInterviewers can ask whatever behavioral, coding, or system design questions they want; there is no standardization for Apple interview questions. However, before an interview loop takes place, some teams will do a quick, informal assignment of what kinds of questions each interviewer is supposed to ask so that they don’t all end up asking the same things.\n\nMoreover, Apple interviewers are untrained, and as soon as a senior engineer is hired they can start conducting interviews.\n\nApple’s unpredictable nature makes it so some of their interview rounds can’t be categorized into behavioral, coding, or system design. Is a philosophical question about products a behavioral question? Not really. But they might ask one in a behavioral round. Are rapid fire infrastructure-focused open-ended trivia questions more system design or coding? It depends.\n\nFor example, here’s how one Apple interviewer describes the behind-the-scenes top-down directive before an upcoming onsite. “Go find a question that would be a good one to ask for our team.” That interviewer then ran it up the chain to an engineer above them. Then, that question immediately got asked in the next interview.\n\nAt Apple, each interview loop is specific to the needs of individual hiring managers – there is no canonical “Apple interview”, and everything is “made to order” for each specific team. That makes it difficult for candidates to prepare.\n\n### Coding\n\nSome teams at Apple prefer practical rounds. Sometimes, they’ll have you write a program on your own laptop and IDE. Other times, they’ll spend the whole round deep diving into a specific technology/use case that’s relevant for their team. For example, a team that wrote in Java and did a lot of work with concurrency had a whole round focused on concurrency in Java!\n\nOther teams do medium-ish LeetCode-style questions.\n\nAt the end of the day, these interviews vary so widely it’s hard to give a specific directive, other than: ask your recruiter. For senior and above candidates, it’s more about demonstrating competence rather than needing to ace the question.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Apple’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Apple coding interview preparation resources](#apple-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nApple interviewers tend to ask questions relevant to a specific team’s work. For instance, a team focused on building web services will tend to ask questions about that, while front-end teams may ask UI-related questions. It may be good to try to get a feel for the day-to-day work from the recruiter/hiring manager, as the job descriptions are not always the most helpful (remember: privacy!).\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIn system design rounds, Apple interviewers love to hear about reliability. If you don’t know what else to talk about, dig into reliability.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nApple’s most important round is usually behavioral or system design. Behavioral rounds are more important than coding rounds.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“In behavioral, you gotta be a rockstar. You gotta be a leader. If you’re abrasive, or if you’re not a cultural fit, how are you going to lead the juniors? And system design is going to weigh a little more than behavioral. If you can’t code or if you’re a little rusty –if you’re good at system design and behavioral–we’ll forgive the subpar coding rounds.”\n\nAn interesting paradox at Apple is: they highly value behavioral rounds but they don’t have a standardized way to assess candidates in those interviews\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Towards the end of my career at Apple, we had a huge need for mobile developers. People who were able to do iOS apps. I was part of an R&D team. We mainly built web products in the beginning, but towards the end of my career we started doing more mobile stuff. We didn't want to hire someone who could only do mobile. We wanted someone who would be half as good at mobile stuff and half as good at web stuff, so they could plug themselves in anywhere.\n\nIf the interview process was standardized across the whole company - you can imagine how hard that would be to test specifically for the niche skill set we needed. Within two days we cooked up a whole new homework assignment just for the ios candidates, we cooked up a whole new set of interview questions. We kept the behavioral part the same. But the technical part - we flipped it over just like that. And it was really good. We changed the way we graded, we were able to filter candidates based on the new set of questions. It was just fast. We didn't get any pushback from HR. We didn't have to work with compliance. We just did it. Really fast. Really nimble.”\n\nBecause Apple doesn’t standardize their interviews, they’re particularly prone to bias. Sometimes the top down guidance to Apple interviewers is something like: “In the behavioral round, just see if you like them. See if you’d like to get a beer with them.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“\\[Interviews are never standardized.\\] And i’ll tell you why. Apple is a very secretive company. Everything is on a need to know basis. Also, it's a hugely political place. It was good for me because I understood the game. I didn’t blame the players I played the game. For those who understand the intricacies of politics, and simply accept the fact that it will happen when you have all Type-A people being paid a tremendous amount of money to do shitty little things, it's bound to happen. You have to accept it or you’re not going to play the game. Everything at Apple is very siloed. Even when it comes down to the cost center. Everything is super independent of one another. That's actually one of the strengths and weaknesses of Apple. We double effort for sure. But that doesn't matter to Tim Cook. They have billions of dollars to afford this – not a problem. I also really liked how it was siloed because teams and their priorities change, leadership changes, a lot of things change. Being able to decouple from the greater company enabled them to become one of the biggest, if not the biggest tech company in the world.”\n\nEven if rounds aren’t standardized, you will definitely be asked “Why Apple?”, and your answer needs to be on point. Some interviewers reject candidates solely for not having a good answer to this question. “Why Apple?” isn’t always a single question; they can spread this out into multiple questions and drill down on this for a good portion of a behavioral round. You can also expect other motivation-based (or “why”) questions.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“A common red flag is giving generic answers to the ‘Why Apple?’ questions. If I didn't feel their passion or if they’re just treating Apple as another job, that’s usually a red flag for me regardless of their technical competence. They really have to somehow convince me – and this is an emotional response they have to bring out of me – they really have to convince me they really want to work at Apple, they really want to roll up their sleeves, and they really believe in our values: delighting the customer, sweating the details. Making awesome products… We only care about that. We don't care about anything else. That emotional response has to be drawn from me and if they don’t then I’m likely to say, ‘They were good but meh.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I can tell you about a great answer one candidate had for ‘Why Apple?”. He said something like… His wife and him were university students dating across two continents. This person said they shared a recent feature – I think it was like when you facetime and you can watch video in sync – he shared how that changed his life. His wife and him went through the whole international relationship because of that. That significantly helped their relationship.”\n\nApple wants to hire candidates whose lives have integrated with the Apple products. And the reverse is true too. It's a fatal flaw to say, “I've never used an iPhone or a Macbook or an iPad” because those people clearly haven’t integrated Apple products deeply in their lives.\n\nApple knows what they like, and they like their products! That doesn’t mean all you have to do is gush about the products to pass the behavioral round. It means you have to tell a genuine story which connects you and Apple products or services. Ideally, a story they will remember.\n\nAnother behavioral factor debated among Apple interviewers is whether or not they agree with the idea that Apple is “cult-ish.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Apple cares most about the ‘Why’. You see that rooted deeply in every apple person's DNA. ‘Why Apple?’ Right? I guess this is where people get this notion of Apple being a ‘cult-ish’ company. Much like Tesla, actually. They have a huge customer following, but you also see the same pattern with their employees. Actually, I totally subscribe to this ideology. Because you want a person you work with day in and day out to have that same passion. Sometimes you're going to have to work overtime. You're not going to get paid extra for that. Sometimes you're going to work weekends. Sometimes shit’s gonna hit the fan. You don't want to work with someone who whines about it.\n\nOur theory is that Apple is more likely to reward employees (and candidates) who act like the leader. [If you listen to 1:00:36 - 1:02:05 in an interview with Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5f8bqYYwps&t=3636), you’ll see some stark similarities to how Apple interviewers talk about the organization. In this clip, he says, “You know how many committees we have? None. We are organized like a startup.” He then describes the benefits of silos and dividing things up.\n\nPrivacy and politics are the natural consequence of a place intentionally designed to be siloed and divided up and kept separate. It’s a cost that Apple accepts because the gain is increased productivity. Put people in closed systems (teams and orgs that don’t talk to other teams and orgs) and watch them get more done. This system works like blinders on a racehorse: it keeps vision focused down the track, on the goal, minimizing peripheral distraction. That’s all they need to see and they run/work faster because of it.\n\nOne final aspect of Apple’s behavioral rounds is that they will ask you specific questions about relevant skills. For example, if a team works with big data, they will ask specifically about a time you have worked with large-scale distributed systems in the context of your answer. If you don’t have direct experience with the field, they will try to get as close as possible, like asking you for what tradeoffs you’ve made when choosing a storage system. These behavioral interview questions serve two purposes: showing you have had relevant experience in the context of what the team is hiring for and trying to get you to talk about a particular behavioral skill (e.g., leadership, conflict resolution).\n\n## How Apple makes hiring decisions\n\nAs evidenced by the highest chaos score, Apple doesn’t do many things in hiring consistently, across the whole company. One trend is that Apple teams rely on post-interview live discussions to make hiring decisions. This varies from somewhat informal (compared to the rest of FAANG) to laughably informal.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Post-onsite feedback for my org was 100% live discussions. At Apple I never had to write feedback. Which made me do more interviews. We made the decision on the same day. Everyone had to make a decision at the end of the day. Do an onsite, then at 5pm, we gather in a single meeting room, we do on the count of three: thumbs up, down, or in the middle. Then we talk after seeing the thumbs. And try to convince the people on the other side. If there’s less than 5 thumbs-up, then that might be an instant rejection. If there’s 6 or 7 or more thumbs up, the ‘thumbs up’ people try to convince the other side. Or in that same situation, the 3 or 4 thumbs down will try to convince the other side.”\n\nBecause of the informal decision-making process and reliance on live discussion, managing the impressions of your interviewers is more important at Apple than at other FAANG. In these decision-making meetings, if there’s dissent, they strive for consensus. The people on one side try to convince the other side. This process can last 15-30 minutes on average; all FAANG companies say interviewers fight for candidates, but Apple tends to fight more than most of them.\n\nBecause of their patterns of live-discussions and striving for consensus, Apple interviewers are more likely to fight for or against you (if your performance was on the fence) than any other FAANG, except _maybe_ Netflix.\n\nUltimately, the hiring manager for that particular role has the most say, which means that that’s the person you should be working to impress the most.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“My manager wanted to hire this person. But he failed my interview so badly. I didn't want to argue with my manager but at the same time I didn't want to work with this person. Because we are hiring people we’d work with on a daily basis. So arguments happen a lot. And in this case, I was the only ‘no’ on the board and the candidate got rejected.”\n\n## Apple coding interview preparation resources\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Apple content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Apple interviewers, long-form solutions to common Apple questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Apple interviews.\n\n### Apple interview replays\n\nBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Apple interviewers on our platform.

Apple's interview process and questions\n    \n\n## Apple's interview process and questions\n\nApple’s interview process consists of the following steps:\n\n*   Recruiter call OR online assessment\n*   Technical phone screen (if you didn’t do the online assessment)\n*   Onsite interview\n\n![Apple’s interview process: recruiter call, technical phone screen, onsite](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fapple-process-flowchart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Apple’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interview experience.\n\nHumans in groups act out a chosen metaphor; Apple isn’t a sports team. They’re an army. Their army is made up of people obsessed with making great products. And they look to hire people who’ve embedded Apple products into their lives. Armies reward loyalty more than sports teams. Apple also has the longest tenured employees in FAANG (we're including Microsoft with FAANG for the purposes of this guide).\n\nApple is decentralized and lets candidates interview with different teams concurrently; if you want to maximize your odds interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I interviewed with like 12 teams. I got 2 offers. Along the way, I told one of the Apple recruiter’s I was interviewing for another Apple team and they shrugged it off; they didn’t care.”\n\nApple’s interview process is more like what you might see at a startup than any other FAANG – from assigning which questions to ask to interviewer training to how hiring decisions get made. Significant inter-team variance is the norm, with each team essentially acting like a startup that’s coming up with its own way of conducting interviews.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\nAt Apple, there’s no formal interviewer training. It’s very ad hoc. Every team is different. There is literally no process. What each of the teams does is rely on one of their very senior engineers or someone very experienced. Apple has a lot of people with long tenures, like 15 years. One of my colleagues had been there for 22 years. At Apple, the more senior you get the more the team trusts you to come up with your own questions. So what the interviewers at Apple typically do: you come up with a question that's not online, and you make sure it’s relevant to what your team is doing. Then you pitch it to your manager or tech lead. Then you run with it.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“One thing not enough candidates know about is this: there’s no such thing as an Apple interview. You apply for a team. Not the company. When people ask me “How to prepare for an Apple interview?” I say ask the recruiter. Because they usually know what types of questions are asked. The recruiter spends 30 minutes or an hour per debrief where engineers are talking about the details about the code. So if the recruiter is paying attention or is at least a little bit technical, they should have a clue whether it’s LeetCode-style questions or embedded style questions. So ask your Apple recruiter a forced-choice question like, ‘Is this interview more X or more Y?’”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I was one of the people to come up with a take-home assignment for candidates. Which was my favorite part of the process at Apple. We were hiring people for full-stack but not just any full-stack – we wanted people who were coding in Python on the back-end and a particular framework on the front-end. We cooked up a take-home which was a scaled down version of what they’d be doing on the job: an internal tool built in those exact technologies. We gave them that take home and had them work on it for a week. Then we discussed it at the onsite where we’d live-debug it and talk about architecture. I really liked this ‘Try before you buy’ style process. Because Apple really wants you to be productive in week 2, if not at the end of week 1.”\n\nApple is the most likely to shock you; they’re more likely to ask you something you didn’t prepare for. Out of all the FAANGs, they’re the ones you can expect to do something unexpected, and some of their tactics can seem mercenary. Apple is the only FAANG which sometimes has a process to cut interviews short if the candidate clearly isn’t meeting the bar – if you don't perform above the bar for the first half of the interview, they’ll cancel the rest.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“If by the fourth round, the hiring manager has gotten consistent feedback that doesn’t meet the bar, then they’d end the onsite early and reject the candidate.”\n\nApple is not results or process oriented. They’re motivation oriented. In other words, they care more about the “Why” than the “What” or the “How”, and as such, they value behavioral interviews more than coding.\n\nApple employees are obsessed with privacy. It’s not just marketing lip service. When asked if “privacy” is a buzzword at Apple, our interviewers said…\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Privacy isn't just a buzzword. We are obsessed with it. To drive that part home. Because it’s so important. And as I mentioned, I was a part of a group focused on gathering user data - users here being Apple internal employees – to inform future products.\n\nEven at Apple, when we’re just getting data from internal employees, we anonymized the data. Just to practice what we preach. Privacy is huge. Another example to illustrate that is that people get fired for torrenting music.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Unless you’re interviewing for a security role, very rarely. Technical people at Apple are hired to do what they do best. They have a whole army of compliance folks and lawyers to take care of that stuff. They also have an internal police force called “InfoSec”, which is the team which takes care of the secrecy stuff. Engineers are needed to do what they were hired to do: engineering.”\n\n### Step 1: Recruiter call\n\nPlease see the section above called [“A note about recruiter calls”](/guides/hiring-process#a-note-about-recruiter-calls) for what to expect. We do encourage you to ask your recruiter what to expect for the rest of the process because as you’ll see, there is a lot of variance from team to team.\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\n“Ask your Apple recruiter forced choice questions with two options, such as, ‘Is this coding round more of a typical LeetCode round, or more of a domain-specific open ended deep dive into a specific technology?’”\n\n### Step 2: Technical phone interview\n\nLike everything else at Apple, the format and technical questions presented in Apple phone screens can vary a ton. Verify this by asking your recruiter!\n\nTechnical phone screens are coding interviews that range from 30 minutes to an hour. This tech interview may be between you and a single interviewer or sometimes a panel of interviewers. It may even be a hiring manager screen with a mix of behavioral questions and coding.\n\nIn any case, the general format is a shared coding environment where the interviewer(s) can assess your ability to utilize basic data structures and algorithms concepts. Being able to provide a solution for coding questions and quickly analyze the runtime complexity of your solution are key skills to have going into this interview.\n\nThe tooling used in Apple’s technical interview rounds depends on the team you’re interviewing with, but we’ve heard that some teams use CoderPad.\n\n### (In some cases) Step 2.5: Take-home assignment\n\nSome teams give candidates a take-home assignment. They can give this around the same time they schedule a phone screen. The hiring manager is usually the person to decide whether or not candidates get one.\n\n### Step 3: Onsite\n\nThere will be roughly six to eight in-person rounds of interviews, each of which will be with your future teammates. Each round will have least one, or possibly two, interviewers.\n\nNote that an onsite loop with one team at Apple will look very different than an onsite loop with another.\n\n## Apple’s interview types in detail\n\nInterviewers can ask whatever behavioral, coding, or system design questions they want; there is no standardization for Apple interview questions. However, before an interview loop takes place, some teams will do a quick, informal assignment of what kinds of questions each interviewer is supposed to ask so that they don’t all end up asking the same things.\n\nMoreover, Apple interviewers are untrained, and as soon as a senior engineer is hired they can start conducting interviews.\n\nApple’s unpredictable nature makes it so some of their interview rounds can’t be categorized into behavioral, coding, or system design. Is a philosophical question about products a behavioral question? Not really. But they might ask one in a behavioral round. Are rapid fire infrastructure-focused open-ended trivia questions more system design or coding? It depends.\n\nFor example, here’s how one Apple interviewer describes the behind-the-scenes top-down directive before an upcoming onsite. “Go find a question that would be a good one to ask for our team.” That interviewer then ran it up the chain to an engineer above them. Then, that question immediately got asked in the next interview.\n\nAt Apple, each interview loop is specific to the needs of individual hiring managers – there is no canonical “Apple interview”, and everything is “made to order” for each specific team. That makes it difficult for candidates to prepare.\n\n### Coding\n\nSome teams at Apple prefer practical rounds. Sometimes, they’ll have you write a program on your own laptop and IDE. Other times, they’ll spend the whole round deep diving into a specific technology/use case that’s relevant for their team. For example, a team that wrote in Java and did a lot of work with concurrency had a whole round focused on concurrency in Java!\n\nOther teams do medium-ish LeetCode-style questions.\n\nAt the end of the day, these interviews vary so widely it’s hard to give a specific directive, other than: ask your recruiter. For senior and above candidates, it’s more about demonstrating competence rather than needing to ace the question.\n\nFor everything you need to prepare for Apple’s coding interview, check out the section called \"[Apple coding interview preparation resources](#apple-coding-interview-preparation-resources)\" below.\n\n### System design\n\nApple interviewers tend to ask questions relevant to a specific team’s work. For instance, a team focused on building web services will tend to ask questions about that, while front-end teams may ask UI-related questions. It may be good to try to get a feel for the day-to-day work from the recruiter/hiring manager, as the job descriptions are not always the most helpful (remember: privacy!).\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIn system design rounds, Apple interviewers love to hear about reliability. If you don’t know what else to talk about, dig into reliability.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nApple’s most important round is usually behavioral or system design. Behavioral rounds are more important than coding rounds.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“In behavioral, you gotta be a rockstar. You gotta be a leader. If you’re abrasive, or if you’re not a cultural fit, how are you going to lead the juniors? And system design is going to weigh a little more than behavioral. If you can’t code or if you’re a little rusty –if you’re good at system design and behavioral–we’ll forgive the subpar coding rounds.”\n\nAn interesting paradox at Apple is: they highly value behavioral rounds but they don’t have a standardized way to assess candidates in those interviews\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Towards the end of my career at Apple, we had a huge need for mobile developers. People who were able to do iOS apps. I was part of an R&D team. We mainly built web products in the beginning, but towards the end of my career we started doing more mobile stuff. We didn't want to hire someone who could only do mobile. We wanted someone who would be half as good at mobile stuff and half as good at web stuff, so they could plug themselves in anywhere.\n\nIf the interview process was standardized across the whole company - you can imagine how hard that would be to test specifically for the niche skill set we needed. Within two days we cooked up a whole new homework assignment just for the ios candidates, we cooked up a whole new set of interview questions. We kept the behavioral part the same. But the technical part - we flipped it over just like that. And it was really good. We changed the way we graded, we were able to filter candidates based on the new set of questions. It was just fast. We didn't get any pushback from HR. We didn't have to work with compliance. We just did it. Really fast. Really nimble.”\n\nBecause Apple doesn’t standardize their interviews, they’re particularly prone to bias. Sometimes the top down guidance to Apple interviewers is something like: “In the behavioral round, just see if you like them. See if you’d like to get a beer with them.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“\\[Interviews are never standardized.\\] And i’ll tell you why. Apple is a very secretive company. Everything is on a need to know basis. Also, it's a hugely political place. It was good for me because I understood the game. I didn’t blame the players I played the game. For those who understand the intricacies of politics, and simply accept the fact that it will happen when you have all Type-A people being paid a tremendous amount of money to do shitty little things, it's bound to happen. You have to accept it or you’re not going to play the game. Everything at Apple is very siloed. Even when it comes down to the cost center. Everything is super independent of one another. That's actually one of the strengths and weaknesses of Apple. We double effort for sure. But that doesn't matter to Tim Cook. They have billions of dollars to afford this – not a problem. I also really liked how it was siloed because teams and their priorities change, leadership changes, a lot of things change. Being able to decouple from the greater company enabled them to become one of the biggest, if not the biggest tech company in the world.”\n\nEven if rounds aren’t standardized, you will definitely be asked “Why Apple?”, and your answer needs to be on point. Some interviewers reject candidates solely for not having a good answer to this question. “Why Apple?” isn’t always a single question; they can spread this out into multiple questions and drill down on this for a good portion of a behavioral round. You can also expect other motivation-based (or “why”) questions.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“A common red flag is giving generic answers to the ‘Why Apple?’ questions. If I didn't feel their passion or if they’re just treating Apple as another job, that’s usually a red flag for me regardless of their technical competence. They really have to somehow convince me – and this is an emotional response they have to bring out of me – they really have to convince me they really want to work at Apple, they really want to roll up their sleeves, and they really believe in our values: delighting the customer, sweating the details. Making awesome products… We only care about that. We don't care about anything else. That emotional response has to be drawn from me and if they don’t then I’m likely to say, ‘They were good but meh.’”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“I can tell you about a great answer one candidate had for ‘Why Apple?”. He said something like… His wife and him were university students dating across two continents. This person said they shared a recent feature – I think it was like when you facetime and you can watch video in sync – he shared how that changed his life. His wife and him went through the whole international relationship because of that. That significantly helped their relationship.”\n\nApple wants to hire candidates whose lives have integrated with the Apple products. And the reverse is true too. It's a fatal flaw to say, “I've never used an iPhone or a Macbook or an iPad” because those people clearly haven’t integrated Apple products deeply in their lives.\n\nApple knows what they like, and they like their products! That doesn’t mean all you have to do is gush about the products to pass the behavioral round. It means you have to tell a genuine story which connects you and Apple products or services. Ideally, a story they will remember.\n\nAnother behavioral factor debated among Apple interviewers is whether or not they agree with the idea that Apple is “cult-ish.”\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Apple cares most about the ‘Why’. You see that rooted deeply in every apple person's DNA. ‘Why Apple?’ Right? I guess this is where people get this notion of Apple being a ‘cult-ish’ company. Much like Tesla, actually. They have a huge customer following, but you also see the same pattern with their employees. Actually, I totally subscribe to this ideology. Because you want a person you work with day in and day out to have that same passion. Sometimes you're going to have to work overtime. You're not going to get paid extra for that. Sometimes you're going to work weekends. Sometimes shit’s gonna hit the fan. You don't want to work with someone who whines about it.\n\nOur theory is that Apple is more likely to reward employees (and candidates) who act like the leader. [If you listen to 1:00:36 - 1:02:05 in an interview with Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5f8bqYYwps&t=3636), you’ll see some stark similarities to how Apple interviewers talk about the organization. In this clip, he says, “You know how many committees we have? None. We are organized like a startup.” He then describes the benefits of silos and dividing things up.\n\nPrivacy and politics are the natural consequence of a place intentionally designed to be siloed and divided up and kept separate. It’s a cost that Apple accepts because the gain is increased productivity. Put people in closed systems (teams and orgs that don’t talk to other teams and orgs) and watch them get more done. This system works like blinders on a racehorse: it keeps vision focused down the track, on the goal, minimizing peripheral distraction. That’s all they need to see and they run/work faster because of it.\n\nOne final aspect of Apple’s behavioral rounds is that they will ask you specific questions about relevant skills. For example, if a team works with big data, they will ask specifically about a time you have worked with large-scale distributed systems in the context of your answer. If you don’t have direct experience with the field, they will try to get as close as possible, like asking you for what tradeoffs you’ve made when choosing a storage system. These behavioral interview questions serve two purposes: showing you have had relevant experience in the context of what the team is hiring for and trying to get you to talk about a particular behavioral skill (e.g., leadership, conflict resolution).\n\n## How Apple makes hiring decisions\n\nAs evidenced by the highest chaos score, Apple doesn’t do many things in hiring consistently, across the whole company. One trend is that Apple teams rely on post-interview live discussions to make hiring decisions. This varies from somewhat informal (compared to the rest of FAANG) to laughably informal.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“Post-onsite feedback for my org was 100% live discussions. At Apple I never had to write feedback. Which made me do more interviews. We made the decision on the same day. Everyone had to make a decision at the end of the day. Do an onsite, then at 5pm, we gather in a single meeting room, we do on the count of three: thumbs up, down, or in the middle. Then we talk after seeing the thumbs. And try to convince the people on the other side. If there’s less than 5 thumbs-up, then that might be an instant rejection. If there’s 6 or 7 or more thumbs up, the ‘thumbs up’ people try to convince the other side. Or in that same situation, the 3 or 4 thumbs down will try to convince the other side.”\n\nBecause of the informal decision-making process and reliance on live discussion, managing the impressions of your interviewers is more important at Apple than at other FAANG. In these decision-making meetings, if there’s dissent, they strive for consensus. The people on one side try to convince the other side. This process can last 15-30 minutes on average; all FAANG companies say interviewers fight for candidates, but Apple tends to fight more than most of them.\n\nBecause of their patterns of live-discussions and striving for consensus, Apple interviewers are more likely to fight for or against you (if your performance was on the fence) than any other FAANG, except _maybe_ Netflix.\n\nUltimately, the hiring manager for that particular role has the most say, which means that that’s the person you should be working to impress the most.\n\n#### Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer\n\n“My manager wanted to hire this person. But he failed my interview so badly. I didn't want to argue with my manager but at the same time I didn't want to work with this person. Because we are hiring people we’d work with on a daily basis. So arguments happen a lot. And in this case, I was the only ‘no’ on the board and the candidate got rejected.”\n\n## Apple coding interview preparation resources\n\nWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Apple content for you!

Amazon Leadership Principles\n    \n\n## Creating the Amazon Leadership Principles guide\n\nWe created this guide after speaking with our community of interviewers, which includes over 100 current and former Amazon engineers, as well as our corpus of mock interviews, which includes close to 500 Amazon Leadership Principles interviews. Our community and our data puts us in a unique position to share Amazon Leadership Principles advice, tips and tricks. If you’re studying for an upcoming Amazon Leadership Principles interview, use our expertise. It’ll give you a serious edge.\n\n## About interviewing.io\n\ninterviewing.io is a mock interview practice platform. In our lifetime, we've hosted close to 100K mock interviews, conducted primarily by senior engineers from FAANG.  \n  \nWe have the recordings from these mock interviews, as well as post-interview feedback and outcomes, which lets us perform some cool and useful analysis!  \n  \nBest of all, interviewing.io lets you book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and many more.\n\n[Book yours today](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\nYouTube: Watch “How interviewing.io Helps Engineers Land Jobs”\n\nThough most of the interviews we've hosted have focused on algorithms/data structures or systems design, we've recently started offering other types of practice as well, including Amazon-specific behavioral interviews. We've hosted close to 500 Amazon behavioral interviews to date.\n\n## How to use the Amazon Leadership Principles guide\n\nWe intentionally structured this guide as two separate parts. [Part 1](#part_1) introduces Amazon's Leadership Principles, discusses high-level strategies, and gives you a high-level view of our approach to the Amazon Leadership Principles. [Part 2](#part_2) will teach you exactly how to answer Amazon Leadership Principles questions, and we'll provide you with a detailed plan so you'll know exactly what to do to excel in your interview. Where you start reading depends on what you want. If you're interviewing at Amazon tomorrow, don't panic—just jump to [Part 2: What to expect, what to avoid, and what to do during an Amazon Leadership Principles interview](#part_2). Otherwise, begin with Part 1 to gain the foundational knowledge that will help you practice most effectively.\n\nWith that being said, our insight does have some limitations. It's worth noting, for example, that the majority of job interviews we looked at for this project were with L6/SDE III candidates, so our data set is skewed toward senior engineers. (For reference, an L6/SDE III at Amazon is roughly equivalent to an L5/Sr. SWE at Google.)\n\nPART 1:\n\n## Amazon Leadership Principles Explained\n\nBefore we dive into specific interview questions, it’s important to understand what the Amazon Leadership Principles are and what they mean for Amazon employees and team members.\n\n## What Amazon Likes\n\n*   Direct challenges\n*   Showing customer obsession (all the time)\n*   Big losses\n*   No answer (more so than a bad answer)\n*   Stories that go in a perfect full circle\n\nVS\n\n## What Amazon Dislikes\n\n*   Conflict rabbit holes\n*   Not enough impact and metrics\n*   Not enough focus on individual contribution\n*   Saying LPs out loud\n*   Misunderstanding \"Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit\"\n\n## What are Amazon’s Leadership Principles (LPs)?\n\n## In a nutshell, Leadership Principles (LPs) are the 16 values Amazon cares the most about.\n\n![Amazon's leadership principles](/static/images/AmazonLPS.svg)\n\nBelow we list the 16 Leadership Principles developed by Jeff Bezos and give a brief overview of each. We’ll also tell you how that value impacts the work environment and share some Leadership Principles questions which could probe for each LP. You’ll notice some of the questions seem irrelevant to the LP they’re listed under; that’s because some Amazonians intentionally design tricky questions. Don’t use these as a way to guess which LP a question is aimed at. For now, use them to start building a model in your head of what these interviews actually look like.\n\n### 1\\. Customer Obsession\n\nCustomer obsession is about giving the customer what they want before they know they want it. It’s a business-driver; engineers who are obsessed with delighting customers will churn out new features faster. Since Amazonians are encouraged to find ways to delight the customer before they know they’d like to be delighted, this promotes repeat business, effectiveness, and innovation.\n\nExample “Customer Obsession” questions:\n\n*   _Tell me about a time when you strongly disagreed with your manager or peer on something you considered very important to the business._\n*   _To try to meet the high expectations of our customers, we sometimes promise more than we can deliver. Tell me about a time when you overcommitted yourself or your company._\n\n### 2\\. Invent and Simplify\n\nAmazon rewards risk-taking. They push the bounds of what’s possible from cloud to e-commerce. They want big ideaters with business savvy; engineers at Amazon are encouraged to innovate as well as cut costs. As big as they grow, they still keep it simple: AWS is the biggest cloud provider in the world, yet Amazon.com strives to be their number one client. That’s an example of a simple solution to a complex problem, which is what this Leadership principle is all about.\n\nExample “Invent and Simplify” questions:\n\n*   _Tell me about a time when you didn’t meet customer’s needs._\n*   _Give me an example of a complex problem you solved with a simple solution._\n\n### 3\\. Learn and Be Curious\n\nVirtually every tech company’s marketing about their culture will include something like this. Curiosity drives learning. Amazon wants smart people who are never satisfied; they want you to always be learning. They promote taking big swings even if you end up missing. You can’t learn from your mistakes without curiosity.\n\nExample “Learn and Be Curious” questions:\n\n*   _Give me an example of a mission or goal you didn’t think was achievable. We all have things about ourselves we'd like to improve on at work. Give me an example of something that you've worked on to improve your overall work effectiveness._\n\n### 4\\. Insist on the Highest Standards\n\nOver the years, Jeff Bezos has repeated the mantra “Every day is day one.” He wants employees who approach every day as if they haven’t accomplished anything yet. That is a very high standard. Another reflection of Amazon’s high standards is how challenging and rewarding it is to become one of their most trusted interviewers, which is called a “Bar Raiser”. A good portion of those who apply don’t make the cut and if you make it your promotion packet gets a big boost. A Bar Raiser can veto the votes of all other interviewers in an onsite round. Those are high standards.\n\nExample “Insist on the Highest Standards” questions:\n\n*   _Tell me about a time when you had to work with a difficult customer or user._\n*   _Tell me about a time when you used external trends to improve your own company's products or services._\n\n### 5\\. Deliver Results\n\nAmazon aims for market domination. This is a company which values the “what” over the “why” and the “how”; they don’t care about how you get there or why you get there as much as they care about you getting there. You get there. In their interviews, they expect candidates to move quickly and without any hints, and they have coding questions on the easier side because they want to get to the optimal outcome as soon as possible.\n\nExample “Deliver Results” questions:\n\n*   _Could you tell me about a time where you were working on a project where you were working with another person. Over time, that person lessened their involvement in the project and you had to take on more responsibility._\n*   _Tell me about a strategic decision you had to make without clear data or benchmarks._\n\n### 6\\. Strive to be the Earth’s Best Employer\n\nIf you’re a software engineer, you won’t get asked about this.\n\n### 7\\. Dive Deep\n\nLike most tech companies, Amazon wants decisions to be made based on data; to implement an idea, you’ll need to show data. Where Amazon is different is this gritty mentality of “get the fricking job done”. Diving deep is essentially pulling yourself up by the bootstraps and making it happen. It’s also about developing a cultural attitude of people who are willing to get their hands dirty in order to win.\n\nExample “Dive Deep” questions:\n\n*   _Tell me about a time when you had to communicate a change in direction that you anticipated people would have concerns with._\n*   _Tell me about a time where you were thrown into a project where you had no experience in._\n\n### 8\\. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit\n\nThis is the most misunderstood Leadership Principle. What it doesn’t mean is “I’ll stand up for myself. Then do it my way regardless of what you say.” What it actually means is “I verbalize the things I disagree on. Then I commit to taking action. Whether it was the action you or I proposed doesn’t matter: I’ll commit to following through on something.” This is also probably the most infamous LP, and it seems to be part of the reason for Amazonian interviewers' higher than normal level of intensity.\n\nExample “Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit” questions:\n\n*   _Often, we must make decisions as a group. Give me an example of a time you committed to a group decision even though you disagreed._\n*   _Tell me about a time where you disagreed with a coworker or PM or manager because you believed the decision they wanted to make was wrong for the customer._\n\n### 9\\. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility\n\nUsually only eng managers get asked about this one, so we’ll skip it.\n\n### 10\\. Ownership\n\nTake accountability. Do all of, if not more than, what the job requires. The intention is to stimulate taking risks, having pride, and sacrificing for the business. Amazon wants folks who take big bets, hold themself to high expectations, and put in the hard work. This is one of the reasons they place a higher value on focusing on their individual contribution when answering Leadership Principles questions.\n\nExample “Ownership” questions:\n\n*   _Describe a time when you took on work outside of your comfort area._\n*   _Describe a situation where you made an important business decision without consulting your manager._\n\n### 11\\. Are Right, A Lot\n\nThis is another value that adds to the energy of a Leadership Principles interview: this is about competition. You have to know your stuff if you’re right, a lot. You also have to be willing to assert your point and back it up with all that data you dove deep for. This LP doesn’t mean Amazonians can’t mess up. They openly encourage candidates to describe times they were wrong, especially when they were wrong on a big gamble. Their ethical decision tree would look something like: Step 1: Dominate. Step 2: Did you dominate? If yes, proceed to success. If not, you better have risked enough to learn if and how domination is possible.\n\nExample “Are Right, A Lot” questions:\n\n*   _Tell me about a time when you did not effectively manage your projects and something did not get completed on time._\n*   _Tell me about a time you wouldn’t compromise on achieving a great outcome when others felt something was good enough._\n\n### 12\\. Hire and Develop the Best\n\nDomination requires finding great players and weeding out the subpar players. They’re the only FAANG company that has a formal title for their “best” interviewers: Bar Raisers. Not only does Amazon compete against other tech companies to find the “best” talent but [they also compete with themselves](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon#amazon). You can interview with multiple teams simultaneously; it’s a dog-eat-dog world at Amazon and that includes dogs in the same pack.\n\nExample “Hire and Develop the Best” questions:\n\n*   _Tell me about a time when you received negative feedback._\n*   _Describe a time when you improved morale and productivity on your team._\n\n### 13\\. Think Big\n\nAmazon has a proven track record with huge ambition, large bets, and rapid expansion to new markets. Going to the moon, for one. Knowing your destination is one thing. It’s another level for your destination to be in the clouds (not an AWS joke, we swear). It’s about having a grand vision of the future so they can achieve those high standards.\n\nExample “Think Big” questions:\n\n*   _Give an example of a creative idea you had that proved really difficult to implement._\n*   _Tell me about a time when you encouraged a team member or organization to take a big risk._\n\n### 14\\. Bias for Action\n\nYou can’t take over the world if you don’t act. You might have the best idea to refactor the codebase in your head, but if it never moves towards implementation, it’s worthless. A straightforward way to make employees more productive is to openly encourage them to produce. Amazon’s bias against inaction affects their interview style: they’re looking for candidates who move fast without hints, who seek market domination, and who deliver results.\n\nExample “Bias for Action” questions:\n\n*   _Give me an example of a calculated risk that you have taken where speed was critical._\n*   _Tell me about a time where you were the first one to take action on something._\n\n### 15\\. Frugality\n\nAmazon is one of the rare companies who openly flaunts being frugal. Since when is “cutting costs” sexy? When it’s said by a group of the terminators who want to dominate the world, that’s when. Amazon wants you to not only figure out how to go to the moon, they want you to cut costs while you do it. One way to impress Amazon in the interview is to talk about the decisions you made in the past which saved the company money. You can learn how to do that in a later section of this guide called “[How to practice for Leadership Principles](https://interviewing.io/guides/amazon-leadership-principles#lp_interview_how_to_practice).”\n\nExample “Frugality” questions:\n\n*   _Tell me about a time you pushed back on a deadline._\n*   _Give me an example of how you have helped save costs or eliminate waste within your role or organization._\n\n### 16\\. Earn Trust\n\nThis is one of the rare Leadership Principles which is not about competition. It’s about cooperation. If you want to demonstrate cooperation, focus on how you understood the other person’s perspective. A difference of opinion is natural and healthy. This LP is about showing you know how to repair: either reactively after or proactively before a difference of opinion.\n\nExample “Earn Trust” questions:\n\n*   _Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with a colleague or manager._\n*   _Describe a time when you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion about a shared goal._\n\nYou can read more about how Amazon defines these LPs [here](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles).\n\n[Amazon's interview process](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/amazon#amazon) involves a) behavioral interview rounds and b) technical interview rounds with a few behavioral questions thrown in. The behavioral questions will all focus on your work history. Importantly, Amazon will decide whether or not to hire you and how much responsibility to give you based partly on how well you demonstrate their Leadership Principles when you discuss your work history.  \n  \nWhat Amazon assesses is consistent between interviewers. Each interviewer will be assigned 1-3 LPs to look for when interviewing you. They're searching for signals on whether you: meet the bar, raise the bar, or are below the bar (for their assigned LPs).  \n  \nBut how Amazon conducts the behavioral round varies widely. Our research has shown that if you were to observe sessions of 10 different LP interviewers, you would discover that each interviewer has their own way of determining a candidate's fit. One interviewer might ask more questions on fewer topics, while another interviewer may do the opposite. Complicating matters, upon observing the same behavior, different interviewers will likely perceive different signals. Notably, there is no consensus on what makes a good answer good.\n\n> \"There is no clear rubric for what type of answer ‘meets or raises the bar.' The evaluation is subjective, and it relies on the interviewer's interpretation of the problem and solution.\"interviewing.io interviewer from Amazon\n\nAlthough you might find this degree of uncertainty intimidating, we'll show you how you can actually use this uncertainty to your advantage and score additional points during your interview.\n\n## How to approach the Amazon Leadership Principles interview\n\nMany candidates treat their interview like a standardized test. But doing so is a serious and costly mistake.  \n  \nA standardized test is unimpressionable, fixed, and objective. Information only flows one way, any modification of structure or content is rejected, and correct answers aren't debatable. But, as we showed above, the individualized approach of Amazon's interviewers makes it clear: Amazon's behavioral round is not a standardized test—it's a game.  \n  \nA game is malleable, dynamic, and subjective. In other words, the behavioral interview is a lot like [Calvinball](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Calvinball). In Calvinball, “While the objective of the game is to win, there is no real way to determine what winning is” ([source](https://www.varsitytutors.com/scholarship_entries/christopher-29302#:~:text=The%20only%20things%20required%20are,to%20determine%20what%20winning%20is.)). That means that you can change the rules. You can mold the field of play to fit your strengths. You're limited solely by your imagination.  \n  \nThese types of games are influenced by cognitive biases, configurable to your advantage, and filled with judgment calls. But, more than anything else, the biggest difference between a standardized test and a game is that the latter involves your counterpart (the interviewer) making up the rules as they go along—just like you.\n\n> \"25% of SDEs who pass the technical bar are disqualified due to behavioral concerns.\"interviewing.io interviewer from Amazon\n\n### Why interview preparation matters\n\nMany engineers wrongly assume that they don't need to prepare for a behavioral interview. They believe they can wing it by simply talking about their past experience because they assume it's something they're already intimately familiar with. However, winging it won't cut it in Amazon's behavioral interview—it's a particularly common failure pattern we see on our platform.  \n  \nAmazon is known for its competitive workplace culture, and most Amazonians seem to get satisfaction from making a behavioral round intense, much more so than most interviewers at other companies. Unprepared candidates are prone to get rattled by the somewhat confrontational, challenging style of these interviewers, causing their performance to suffer as a result.  \n  \nTo avoid that same fate and actually excel in the interview, you'll need to learn about what Amazon cares about (the LPs) and discover how to respond to their tricky questions without getting flustered. Do that, and you'll increase your odds of both getting hired and receiving a higher level of responsibility.\n\n> \"I wish more candidates would prepare well in advance for our behavioral questions. I wish they knew the questions' patterns and were prepared to speak about their experience in an effective way.\"interviewing.io interviewer from Amazon\n\n## High-level strategy to frame your Leadership Principles interview\n\nIn this section, we'll teach you a strategy that will increase your odds of success while lowering your stress. We think it's important to explain why you should use this strategy and how we analyzed and bucketed these LPs to maximize your hit rate.\n\n### The most common pitfall to avoid\n\nWhen it comes to preparing for Amazon's interview, one popular strategy is to guess which LP a question is asking about before answering the question. Unfortunately, there are 16 different LPs to keep track of, so your odds of guessing correctly are low; your interviewer may ask tricky, confusing, or challenging questions that are designed to push back, probe, or catch you off guard; and you can't predict if the interviewer will even detect signal of the LP you're trying to convey.  \n  \nThere has to be a simpler way to crack this, and we think we've found it.\n\n### Put Customer Obsession above all else\n\nIf we can determine what concepts these LPs have in common, then you can simply show signal for a bucket of LPs instead of attempting to laser focus your answer on one LP. This will make it easier for you to prepare for the interview and also increase your odds of success.  \n  \nWe spent a lot of time analyzing the 16 LPs, identifying their shared themes, and placing them into buckets. Searching for the most efficient and effective way to group the LPs, we discovered that every LP has one common denominator: customer obsession. This is Amazon's favorite value. It's their north star. Without customer obsession, Amazon wouldn't be Amazon.  \n  \nBut if all 16 LPs can be reduced down to one concept, then what's the point of following the status quo and guessing which LP a question is asking about? Because, technically, wouldn't the answer be customer obsession every time?  \n  \nYes, and that's our point. Though it may be tempting to do otherwise, you should ignore the urge to guess which specific LP lies beneath a question. It's more likely to hurt than it is to help.  \n  \nInstead, broadcast the idea that you are obsessed with delighting customers. Signal this idea early and often; make this your new default system. In such a generalized interview format with so much subjectivity, you want to cover as wide of a surface area as possible. Demonstrating customer obsession is the closest thing we've found to a cheat code.\n\nPART 2:\n\n## What to expect, what to avoid, and what to do during an Amazon Leadership Principles interview\n\nNow that we've explained why you should condense the LPs into a single bucket (customer obsession), it's time to learn everything you need to know in order to craft your own ideal answers.\n\n## What to expect when answering questions about Amazon Leadership Principles\n\nExpect your interviewer or hiring manager to directly challenge your answers. Here's an excerpt from a tech lead interview at Amazon. Let's take a look at how it flows.\n\nEXAMPLE QUESTION:\n\n\"How do you make sure you're focused on the right deliverables when you have several competing priorities?\"\n\n1ST FOLLOW-UP QUESTION:\n\n\"Can you tell me about a time when you did not manage priorities and something fell through the cracks?\"\n\n2ND FOLLOW-UP QUESTION:\n\n\"What could you have done better?\"\n\n3RD FOLLOW-UP QUESTION:\n\n\"I don't think you answered the question. I think you're answering a more generic question. I'm asking you to tell me about a time when your process for competing priorities didn't work.\"\n\nThe topic of the initial Question is ambiguous: there's no known optimal solution for managing priorities. The 1st Follow-up Question is about failure. Essentially, so far, the interviewer has said, “Hey, give me your philosophy on a subject for which there's no consensus,” followed by, “Okay, now tell me how that philosophy of yours is imperfect.” That's a direct challenge.  \n  \nThe 2nd Follow-up Question is also about failure. And the 3rd Follow-up Question is another direct challenge. In fact, you might never see a stronger direct challenge than the 3rd Follow-up Question.  \n  \nThis is classic Amazon. Ambiguity and failure can be intimidating enough on their own, but Amazon doesn't stop there. They turn up the heat to test your ability to handle pressure.  \n  \n\n## Four common mistakes to avoid when answering Amazon interview questions\n\nIn addition to learning what to expect in an interview, it's important to identify common mistakes that candidates make so you can avoid them in your own interview. Here, we will focus on the mistakes themselves.\n\n## Most Common Mistakes in Terms of Content\n\n![The most common mistakes that Amazon interviewees make in terms of content](/static/images/CommonMistakes.svg)\n\nIn addition to learning what to expect in an interview, it's important to identify common mistakes that candidates make so you can avoid them in your own interview. Here, we will focus on the mistakes themselves.\n\nMISTAKE #1\n\n### Not enough impact or metrics\n\nThe most common critical feedback given by interviewers is either: “It would have been better if you described more impact” or “It would have been better if you mentioned more metrics.”  \n  \nAmazon likes business and scale. An answer without impact means Amazon can't get a read on your business acumen. An answer without metrics gives Amazon no way to determine scale.  \n  \nOne reason candidates don't mention impact or metrics is because they think they can only use impact or metrics that are accurate with 100% certainty. Lastly, one additional reason people fail to include impact or metrics is that they simply aren't sure how to find them. (If you want to learn how to find impact and metrics right now, then jump to Step 1 of [How to Practice for LP](#lp_interview_how_to_practice).)  \n  \n\nMISTAKE #2\n\n### Falling down rabbit holes when asked about conflict\n\nCandidates frequently get tripped up when asked questions about conflict. We can't tell you how to avoid every possible pitfall, but we can tell you how to avoid the most common one: Trying to prove that you were right.  \n  \nTwo things that interviewers absolutely do not want to hear when you're speaking about conflict:\n\nWhy your X approach was better than your colleague's Y approach.\n\nThe minute details of your X approach and of your colleague's Y approach.\n\nThis is where many people get stuck. It doesn't matter who had the better technical approach. Don't try to justify to the interviewer that you were right and your colleague was wrong. Avoid this trap.\n\nYou may have spent a lot of time thinking about this, but that doesn't mean you need to share a lot about it. Once again, your goal is not to prove that you were correct. Therefore, you shouldn't speak at length about why a proxy server was the best solution or explain the usability drawbacks of changing the hosting environment. Less is more in this case. If they want more detail, they'll ask about it in their follow-up questions.Some of the other common ways people fail during questions about conflict: rambling for five minutes before describing the actual conflict, talking about a conflict from 10 years ago, focusing on the intensity of the conflict instead of what happened during the conflict, and speaking about a conflict where the topic seems trivial for someone at their level.\n\nMISTAKE #3\n\n### Not focusing on individual contribution\n\n> \"When talking about your projects, most of your words should be about ‘I' not ‘We.' Your answer should mainly be about your individual contribution.\"interviewing.io interviewer from Amazon\n\nAccording to our research, the third most common reason engineers fail interviews is a lack of focus on their individual contributions when discussing their work history. Typical feedback from interviewers looked like this: “I got an understanding of what the project was about and what work was involved in general, but I couldn't really get a sense of what you did.”  \n  \nAgain, Amazonian and non-Amazonian interviewers both deduct points when a candidate fails to focus on their individual contribution. But some speculate that Amazonians dock more points than other companies when someone misses the mark here. Don't get caught up in an in-depth walk-through of how the technology works, the specific structure of the business units, or the intricacies of what everybody else was doing. Say “I”!\n\nMISTAKE #4\n\n### Saying Leadership Principles out loud\n\nIf you're the candidate, don't recite LPs out loud. It sounds clunky and unnatural.\n\n## Not Ok\n\n*   Saying “customer obsession”\n*   Saying “deliver results”\n\nVS\n\n## Ok\n\n*   Saying “delighting users is important”\n*   Saying “get stuff done”\n\nTakeaway: you can riff, but don't “copy and paste.”\n\nWe've focused so far on the most common reasons candidates lose points in an Amazon behavioral interview, but now let's take a look at strategies you can use to make a positive impact.\n\n## Tips for a successful Amazon behavioral interview\n\nNow that you know what to avoid during your interview, let&s dive into some best practices and tips for passing your behavioral interview with flying colors.\n\n### Beat the drum with customer obsession—the most important Leadership Principle\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, all of the LPs have one common denominator: customer obsession. It's never a bad time to demonstrate a keen focus on meeting customers' needs; to borrow a quote from Wedding Crashers: “It's like pizza, baby—it's good no matter what!  \n  \nTo make your answers stronger, you can show signal for customer obsession in places where it doesn't seem to apply. Take this question, for example: “Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a colleague or a manager. What was the situation? How did you resolve it?”\n\n## ANSWER AWithout customer obsession framing\n\n*   I had to organize and refactor the codebase. And I thought object-oriented programming was the best approach. But one of my teammates did not buy in. I tried to explain the benefits but did not sway him. I wanted to get the work done, so I ended up going ahead with the approach he proposed. At the end of the day, delivering the feature was more important than proving my point to stick with the object-oriented approach. I made peace with my teammate and went ahead with his approach.\n\nVS\n\n## ANSWER AWith customer obsession framing\n\n*   I had to reorganize the codebase and refactor the codebase. And I thought object-oriented programming was the best approach. But my teammate didn't buy in. For the sake of pushing something to prod quicker, we ended up going with his approach. But looking back on it, I wish I would have fought more for the object-oriented approach, and the reason is because user experience is really important to me. If we had the codebase nicely structured with object-oriented design and patterns and hierarchy, it'd make it way easier to maintain and more robust and less buggy. So later on we could develop cool new features for customers and push them out quicker.\n\nData collected from a representative sample of Amazon behavioral interviews showed us what to do and what to avoid during an interview.\n\n### No answer is often better than a bad answer\n\nIt's all right to say: “I don't have an answer for that,” or “I can't think of an example for this question.” In fact, interviewers don't expect you to have an answer for every single question they ask. Unless it's a question your interviewer thinks is insanely common, you're not going to lose points for passing on one question. Obviously, you don't want to dodge four behavioral interview questions in a row. But, overall, no answer is better than a bad answer.\n\n> \"It's better to share no example than a bar-lowering example. For instance, if the interviewer asks you to share a time you ‘Insisted on the Highest Standards,' and you talk about code formatting one source file, that is almost definitely a negative mark against you. It would be better to share nothing at all.\"interviewing.io interviewer from Amazon\n\n### The most misunderstood Amazon leadership principle\n\nHave backbone; disagree and commit is not about making people do it your way. This is the most misunderstood LP. It's easy to over-focus on the competitive traits Amazon likes; determined to show they're a good fit for Amazon, candidates seem to spin their past work history to make it seem like they're ultra-competitive.  \n  \nIf it's impossible to do it your way, are you able to go ahead with someone else's plan? Or do you block? If it's impossible to do it your way, accommodating a conflicting idea after you've clearly asserted your point is perfectly reasonable. To showcase this in an interview, you might describe how you told your colleague:\n\n> \"Hey, I don't agree. And I don't agree for these reasons. I think it's not going to work. However, for the sake of getting the work done, I'm on board. And down the road, if things aren't going as planned, then we can circle back and revisit this discussion.\"\n\n### Follow four rules when speaking about conflict\n\nWhen answering questions about conflict, do your best to clearly describe the conflict you're referencing, ensure the conflict is pertinent to the level of the job you're applying for, choose a conflict that resulted in significant discussion or back and forth, and stick to the facts.RULE #1\n\n#### Clearly articulate the conflict in the first few seconds of your answer.\n\nDon't make your interviewer wait. After you share the conflict, pause briefly to let it sink in.\n\n> EXAMPLE:\"In my current role, a conflict occurred over choosing how to integrate a third-party software. The conflict was: my manager and I couldn't agree on an approach.\"\n\nRULE #2\n\n#### Make sure the topic of a conflict is relevant to your level.\n\nA topic relevant to a junior engineer is something like choosing variable names. For senior engineers, it'd be about something more significant such as deciding how to design the architecture or choosing one database over another.RULE #3\n\n#### Choose actual conflicts, not potential conflicts.\n\nA conflict is a disagreement drawn out over time. If there wasn't much discussion about it or time didn't pass while it persisted, then it probably wasn't a conflict. If this is the case, it was more of a “potential conflict that got resolved quickly.” If it wasn't a conflict, then don't position it as one.\n\n## Example of a potential conflict that got resolved quickly\n\n*   “They said X. I said Y. And then they said, ‘Oh, you're right. Actually, Y is better.' And then we did Y.”\n\nVS\n\n## Example of an actual conflict\n\n*   “They said X. I said Y. And then time passed. They still said X and I still said Y. So, I did research on X and Y. More time passes. I showed this research to get buy-in from some Important People. Then I showed my research to the People Who Said X. More time passes. The People Who Said X weren't convinced until Z happened. Then the People Who Said X got on board and said Y.”\n\nRULE #4\n\n#### Focus on what happened and stick to the facts.\n\nDefine the conflict, describe how the conflict was resolved, share the steps you took to resolve it, and state the outcome.\n\n> EXAMPLE:\"One conflict I had with my manager was about integrating a third-party API. They thought this service would improve performance. My research showed it improved performance marginally but complicated maintenance significantly. After gaining support from the team lead, I walked my manager through the data flows. They weren't convinced; however, they were more open to the idea. At the urging of myself and the team lead, the manager took it to one of their stakeholders who agreed that the long-term maintenance costs were too high to justify using this service. This led to us not integrating the third-party service that had been proposed.\"\n\n### Share experiences where you took a big loss\n\nPart of the [definition of earn trust says](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles) that Amazon wants leaders who are “vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing,” so don't be afraid of telling Amazon how you've struck out swinging for the fences. You're encouraged to highlight the benefit that getting this “win” would have brought to your team. And, to give you an idea of the big-scale losses they want to hear about, you can talk about failures that resulted in losing a contract, losing future business, or losing a lot of money.\n\n### Questions the candidate asks the interviewer are an opportunity to show signal\n\nGreat candidates demonstrate signal in places most candidates might overlook, such as the questions they ask the interviewer when wrapping up.\n\n> Question from the candidate:\"Let's say you have a user who used to use the Alexa services when they were a new user, but now they don't use the Alexa services anymore. How do you collect the data to understand what went wrong, so you can improve user experience? Most users are going to ignore surveys, so how do you learn about stuff like what features they didn't like?\"\n\nBy framing it around user experience, this question broadcasts customer obsession. It's crucial to take advantage of every opportunity to broadcast signal, so don't ignore the importance of asking questions in a strategic way.\n\n## How to practice for a Leadership Principles interview in six steps\n\nAn average candidate will go online, get a list of behavioral interview questions, immediately start typing answers to the questions, and maybe get some feedback from friends.  \n  \nThe primary error here is implementing a solution before understanding the problem. Another error here is the lack of a robust QA process between the initial answer you type out and the answers you say in an interview. What are the chances you got it right the first time? What are the odds that your original answer left a bunch of data unsaid? And what if the data you're leaving behind is better than what you wrote down in your first draft?  \n  \nAnother mistake is that friends often go easy on you and frequently lack the knowledge or skill to give you actionable feedback. When learning from friends, the best case scenario is you learn less than you should, and the worst case is you learn the wrong stuff entirely.\n\nThere are six steps you should follow to prepare for Amazon Leadership Principles interview so you can beat the game.![Six steps to prepare for an Amazon Leadership Principles interview](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FSixSteps.png&w=1920&q=75)\n\n### \n\n1\n\nExtract the raw data\n\nApproach the raw data extraction like a brain dumpA brain dump is “the act or an instance of comprehensively and uncritically expressing and recording one's thoughts and ideas (as on a particular topic)” ([Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/brain%20dump)). Don't worry yet about the quality of what you extract, and don't focus too much on how it all sounds. Your goal is just to get everything written/typed out.  \nPrepare for follow-up questions.For more than 40 years the [STAR framework](https://cdn-images.zety.com/pages/what_is_the_star_interview_method.jpg) has remained the de facto standard method for structuring answers to behavioral questions. STAR doesn't protect you from an ornery engineer drilling down for 15 minutes on some obscure detail about a project you did two years ago. So, how do you prepare for follow-up questions? Grill yourself until you've extracted enough data. You can either spend a reasonable amount of time grilling yourself before the interview, or you can spend an unreasonable amount of time getting grilled during the interview.\n\n> \"Interviewers may spend 10-15 minutes on a single point, asking multiple follow-up questions and going deep into the point.\"interviewing.io interviewer from Amazon\n\nSelf Reflection\n\nFor each project you've worked on in the past few years, ask yourself these questions:\n\nWhat business problem was this project supposed to solve?\n\nWhat were the greatest technical challenges? (Usually, the more interesting ones are the ones you didn't expect)\n\nWhat approach did you take?\n\nWhat are the drawbacks to the approach you chose?\n\nWhat alternative approaches did you consider?\n\nHow did you compare the approaches?\n\nWhat tradeoffs did you consider?\n\nHow did you profile them?\n\nHow did you compare scalability for each?\n\nWhat was your vision for how each technology would evolve over time?\n\nWhat were the functional challenges?\n\nDid you have to do something faster than usual?\n\nOr with less resources than usual? How new was the subject matter to you?\n\nHow many other teams or stakeholders did you work with on this?\n\nHow much pre-established process was there in place for your role?\n\nWhat were the interpersonal challenges?\n\nWhat did you learn?\n\nDiscover some gems.Grilling yourself will give you a ton of data. But most of that data won't be impressive to an outsider. Much of it might be muck. But that's OK! Within the muck, there will be some gems, pieces of well-crafted language. After you've uncovered these gems, search them for any signal of customer obsession. Gems don't need to have that signal. However, a gem with any of these signals is inherently a more valuable gem because it's tailor-made for Amazon.\n\nExample Gems\n\nFor each project you've worked on in the past few years, ask yourself these questions:\n\nI found a security vulnerability in our cloud infrastructure which saved the company 3 million dollars in annual customer support costs.\n\nThe main project I worked on for the last two years was a bot detection project to stop fraud. As a part of my research, I spoke with the 10+ teams (including some Staff-level engineers) who had attempted to solve this problem but failed. I noticed they all did the same thing - they made an assumption that hackers aren't always evolving. These other teams were implementing 1 idea every 6 months or 1 idea per year. My team (myself and a data scientist) was able to implement 5 ideas per week. So, in some sense, we were moving more than 125X faster than the other engineers who had previously worked on this problem. We ended up solving the problem, getting some patents, and saving the company a bunch of money.\n\nThis is something that I learned the first time I built my own user authentication from scratch. Any way you authenticate users, there are always going to be security risks.\n\nI made a software application that controls a very fancy refrigerator. I wrote 5-10k lines of code for this project. The most challenging part was linking up three different aspects (which were all over the stack) to talk to each other. Low-level hardware interfacing, which was all wrapped up. And then there's the back end logic that controls the data ingest and data logging and data processing. Lastly, there's the front end which is a graphical application with live plots and switches and dials and stuff.\n\nFind a bunch of metrics and impact.You don't need to be 100% certain about the numbers; that's unreasonable. When it comes to your work history, especially for companies you no longer work for, your best guess is good enough.\n\nMetrics and Impact\n\nIf you want to find metrics and impact for anything you've built, you can ask yourself questions such as:\n\nHow large was its dataset or how many rows of data were analyzed to make it?\n\nHow many devices/users did it launch to or will it launch to?\n\nHow many engineering hours did it save? How many non-engineering hours did it save? How often (how many times per year) will these hours be saved? What is the cost of those yearly hours?\n\nHow much money is processed by it?\n\nHow much more accurate or effective was it than a given benchmark?\n\nHow much was efficiency or productivity increased by it?\n\nWhat did users or colleagues say about it?\n\n### \n\n2\n\nFrame the data\n\nWhat is the process to turn your raw data into something polished for an interview?You have your raw data. Next, you have to figure out how you want to frame the data, then you apply the data to the frame you chose, then you see what story the data is telling, and then see if someone else can understand the story. To begin, let's observe a perfect answer that you can emulate. This will become your frame.\n\nExample of a perfect answer to an LP question (i.e., your frame)We listened to hundreds of interview responses to find this perfect LP answer. First, we are going to demonstrate why it is such an effective answer. Then we encourage you to listen to the answer in its entirety.\n\nA great answer goes in a perfect, full circle.The candidate's answer starts with a key statement of the problem and ends with a summary of how he solved the problem. When you craft stories that go in a perfect, full circle (from problem to solution), your impact is baked into the answer.\n\nSpeak in a way that both an expert and an idiot can understand.Albert Einstein said: “You don't really understand you examine the answer, notice how simple his word choice is. Every word in the sentence is necessary, yet there are no words you have to google to understand.\n\nFocus on individual contribution.Most of his answer focuses on the actions he took (i.e., his “individual contribution”). Because of this, he avoids getting bogged down by minutiae, such as technical jargon, details on how these teams and business units work, the specifics of the approach they took in this architecture, or explaining how this particular technology functions.\n\nHear the perfect LP answer for yourself (don't mind the sharks 😉 )\n\n### \n\n3\n\nIterate\n\nNow that you have your frame, you can build answers atop the frame to see how they fit. Doing this will help you find out what works and what doesn't.\n\nTalk through your answers.The best way to practice is with an experienced interviewer who has domain expertise. If that's not available to you, then you'll want to use our example questions, record some answers, and analyze your own responses. Overall, this isn't a bad choice, but it isn't as helpful as practicing with an expert because feedback from yourself is limited by blind spots.\n\nUse gems, metrics, and impact as much as possible.It's impossible to overdo it with these three skills. There's nowhere in an answer that they can't be used effectively. Get comfortable using them. Experiment. Find what works for you.\n\nClearly answer the question and demonstrate your passion for delighting customers.As we proved earlier, there's little to no value in guessing the underlying LP or attempting to aim your answer at one specific LP. Instead, practice answering each question clearly and broadcasting your obsession with making customers happy.\n\nMake 80% of your answer about individual contribution.Focus on making “I” statements (as in, “actions that I took”). This leaves 20% of your answer to cover “everything else.” Some examples of “everything else” are: a) “We” (or “actions we took”), b) “How stuff works in this company (or team or organization),” and c) “little things worth mentioning.”\n\n### \n\n4\n\nRefine the stuff that works\n\nNow that you have practiced giving answers with some framing, you should have a better idea of what works. At this point, you can refine the story your data is telling. This means (partially or fully) scripting out your answers. How much to script depends on your preferences; some people prefer room for improvisation, while others would rather know exactly what they're going to say.  \n  \nOnce you have a basic outline of the key points to hit, or the answer scripted out in full, you can measure what story your data is telling. To achieve this, consider how much signal for customer obsession is found in your answers.  \n  \nFinally, it's time to benchmark how effective you are at conveying your story to someone else.\n\n### \n\n5\n\nGo from good to great\n\nGet actionable feedback from actual Amazon interviewers.Admittedly, we're biased, and we think you should use the interviewers on [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io) 🙃 Mock interviewing with experts will take you from good to great because it accurately simulates the environment of an interview. It's just like the real interview but without negative consequences; think of it as a proxy server for your job search. You get what you need (actionable feedback) from a reliable source (an Amazon interviewer) and there's no risk involved (you can't get rejected).\n\n[Schedule a mock interview](https://interviewing.io/signup)\n\n### \n\n6\n\nAdopt the Amazon mindset\n\nEmbrace the fire.In the spirit of competition, Amazon turns up the heat to see how you react to the flame.

And in order to beat the game, there's one thing that we want to make sure we're on the same page about…\n\n## \n\n## Amazon Leadership Principles interview question examples\n\nMost Amazon behavioral questions fall into one of 5 buckets. In this question bank we will define the 5 buckets and give you a few example questions in each bucket.\n\n## \n\nBucket #1: Technical problem solving\n\nIf you ignore the “spin” some of these questions have on them (complexity, simplicity, novelty, etc.), these questions are straightforward; this bucket is about how you solve technical problems.\n\nTell me about your project which was the toughest in terms of technical challenges.\n\nGive me an example of a complex problem you solved with a simple solution. What made the problem complex? How do you know your solution addressed the problem?\n\nGive me an example of a time you proposed a novel approach to a problem. What was the problem and why did it require a novel approach? Was your approach successful?\n\n## \n\nBucket #2: Learning (and failure)\n\nThese questions ask you about times you learned lessons. Sometimes lessons are learned through research you did or curiosities you followed. Sometimes lessons are learned from mistakes you made (you can define failure as “knowledge gained through first-hand experience.”)\n\nHow do you approach learning new technologies?\n\nGive me an example of a significant professional failure. What led you to making the wrong decision? What did you learn from this situation?\n\nWe all have things about ourselves we'd like to improve on at work. Give me an example of something that you've worked on to improve your overall work effectiveness. What resources did you identify to help you develop? What was the impact?\n\nTell me about a time when you were wrong.\n\n## \n\nBucket #3: Getting stuff (for the business) done\n\nThese questions are about your ability to achieve desired outcomes for the business.\n\nTell me about a time when you went above and beyond for a customer. Why did you do it? How did the customer respond? What was the outcome?\n\nTell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility. Why was it important? What was the outcome?\n\n​​Tell me about a time when you had to deliver something at a very tight timeline.\n\n## \n\nBucket #4: Interpersonal conflict\n\nThis is the most discussed bucket of Amazon questions. It's about conflicts with other people.\n\nTell me about a time when you had a disagreement with a colleague or manager.What was the situation and how did you resolve that?\n\nTell me about a time where you disagreed with a coworker or PM or manager because you believed the decision they wanted to make was wrong for the customer.\n\nTell me about a time when you strongly disagreed with your manager or peer on something you considered very important to the business.\n\n## \n\nBucket #5: Ambiguity\n\n“Ambiguity” questions are easy to identify because the question will present two opposing or conflicting ideas.\n\nGive me an example of when you had to make an important decision and had to decide between moving forward or gathering more information.What did you do? What was the outcome? What information is necessary for you to have before acting?\n\nGive me an example of a calculated risk that you have taken where speed was critical.What was the situation and how did you handle it ?

In our lifetime, we've hosted close to 100k mock interviews, conducted primarily by senior engineers from FAANG. We have the recordings from these interviews, as well as feedback and outcomes, which lets us perform cool and useful analysis, like the kind in this guide. We’ve also helped thousands of engineers get jobs and negotiate their salaries, and along the way we’ve built a community of people dedicated to helping each other get better.\n\n[Join our community](/signup)\n\n![YouTube: Watch \"How interviewing.io Helps Engineers Land Jobs\"](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fwho-we-are-video.1fd791bd.png&w=1080&q=75)\n\nYouTube: Watch \"How interviewing.io Helps Engineers Land Jobs\"\n\n## What this guide is and whom it's for\n\nCandidates often get overwhelmed with system design. We don’t blame them. There are literally hundreds of topics you can study when preparing for an interview. But does that mean that you should drop everything and go study all of them? Absolutely not. It’s vital to master the basic principles first.\n\nMastering the fundamentals will go a long way in system design. When you’re new to a subject, there can be diminishing returns by studying too much over a short period of time, and this can actually hurt you in a real interview. Early in your preparation, it can help to know more and have more options, but this can also cause you to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of potential answers, possibly leading you toward overcomplicated solutions.\n\nOur experience has shown us that 80% percent of system design interviews involve only 20% of the concepts. This guide will teach you those key concepts in depth to increase your odds of excelling during an interview.\n\nOur primary audience is backend-leaning engineers who are interviewing for mid-level to senior-level roles. Whether you’re new to system design interviews or you’re a seasoned system design interviewer looking to refresh or hone your skills, this guide is for you.\n\n## How we made this guide\n\nWe began by listening to 30+ hours of system design interviews and system design lessons. We then performed data analysis to identify 50+ of our highest rated interviewers.\n\nCollectively, the interviewers who worked on this guide have conducted thousands of system design interviews in the wild, and we stress-tested this material by asking engineers who were new to system design to take our ideas for a spin.\n\nOur unique data set (the collective knowledge of our interviewers and our database of recorded interviews) makes us well equipped to tell you exactly what to expect in an interview. If we discuss something in this guide, it’s likely to appear in 80% of mid-level / senior interviews.\n\nRead on to gain insight from the people on the other side of the table, who will give you unique access to the only thing separating you from the high-TC job you seek: the minds of your interviewers.\n\n## How to use this guide\n\n### This guide is structured into 4 parts.\n\n1.  How to approach a system design interview\n2.  Key topics to understand\n3.  A 3-step framework to crush any system design interview\n4.  Watch us design popular systems from scratch, and learn how to get unstuck\n\nNew to system design interviews? We recommend reading Parts 1-4 in order. The first two sections will introduce you to the high-level theories that will help you ease into the practical exercises and advanced strategies found in Parts 3 and 4.\n\nIf you have completed several system design interviews, feel free to begin with Part 4, which includes advanced techniques and practical tips to help you pass your interview. Afterward, you can quickly review Parts 1-3 by focusing on topics that seem helpful to you.\n\nWe created this guide because we want to provide you with a shortcut to interview success. At the same time, we don’t want you to take any shortcuts in your preparation. So we’ve got a bit of a paradox, because on one hand, we want to teach you the cheat codes that will help you beat the game, but on the other hand, we want you to put in the sweat equity required to learn the intricacies of system design yourself. The truth is that there are no royal roads, and a good interviewer will be able to recognize if you haven’t put in the work. By reading this guide and really thinking about it, you’ll learn enough to be prepared for your interview, and along the way we will provide you with a collection of tricks that will make everything easier. So here’s your shortcut, but don’t take any shortcuts.\n\n### Editor’s note\n\nWe use the terms “machine,” “server,” and “node” interchangeably throughout the guide.\n\n### Table of Contents\n\nThe “Table of Contents,” located on the left side of the screen, is designed to help you find and navigate the stuff you need. Use it. That way you can revisit conceptual sections to get a refresher and fast forward to sections you’re most interested in.\n\nTo give you a heads up, it will take about 6 hours (3.5 reading and 2.5 watching videos) to consume all 4 parts of this guide. We promise those hours will be incredibly well spent!\n\n### Rule of thumb\n\nIf you have an upcoming system design interview and you're vastly unprepared, **the best thing you can do is reschedule your interview.** The bigger the company, the less they care about rescheduling.\n\nExceptions to this Rule of thumb: you have an extenuating circumstance that requires you to get a job fast (e.g., visa issues).\n\n### Legend\n\nRule of thumb\n\nQuestion\n\nAnecdote\n\nOutlaw idea \\*\n\nRemember\n\nWarning\n\nTip\n\nHow to Get Yourself Unstuck\n\n\\* Note: an “outlaw idea” is a divergent or controversial idea\n\n## Introduction to System Design\n\nYou may be reading this guide because you recently failed a system design interview. Or you watched a YouTube video that made system design seem like an overwhelming topic you’ll never fully grasp. Or perhaps you have years of experience working in the field, yet you struggle to demonstrate your technical prowess in the brief span of a system design interview.\n\n### Do not panic!\n\n![Do not panic laptop](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdo-not-panic.0023b194.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**Professional experience with distributed systems isn’t needed to pass system design interviews.** And even if you do have that experience, keep in mind that many talented distributed systems engineers still struggle with the system design interview format. How you perform in an interview is not a measure of your worth as a software engineer—it is a measure of your ability to do system design interviews. The two are related but not equal; being a good programmer has a surprisingly small role in passing interviews.\n\n### Anecdote\n\nOne of our experts was asked: “As an experienced engineer without any scalable systems experience, how can I go into something like a FAANG system design interview when I have never designed those systems before?” Here’s the expert’s reply:\n\n\"I worked at Facebook for five and a half years. I learned more about system design from reading the internal interviewing wiki than I ever got from working at Facebook. They've got all kinds of distributed systems knowledge there, and it’s concentrated in a handful of infrastructure teams who build really great libraries and really great backend systems. That means that the rest of us never have to think about distributed systems. We get to say, 'I'm gonna make a new data type, and if I dump a billion records in it tomorrow, it doesn't matter. The systems folks have my back.' I worked at Facebook for a really long time, but I learned almost nothing about designing systems from experience.\"\n\n### Remember\n\nYou can pass system design interviews even if you’ve never designed distributed systems before. If you have copied files between machines with drag-and-drop, you are halfway there. If you implemented clients or servers or have opened network connections, you’ve got this. This guide will teach you the most important 20% of information that will appear 80% of the time in system design interviews. By the end of this guide you won’t be an expert, but you’ll be well on your way to being a better engineer and a much better interview candidate.\n\n## The difference between engineering problems and design problems\n\n**In this excerpt taken from Design Your Life**, written by two Stanford professors and engineers, you’ll get a better understanding of how different problems require different approaches. We bolded to emphasize the parts that are most important to note.\n\n“There’s a difference between design problems and engineering problems... **Engineering is a good approach to solving a problem when you can get a great deal of data and you’re sure there is one best solution.** Bill \\[one of the authors\\] worked on the problem of engineering the hinges on Apple’s first laptops, and the solution he and his team came up with made those laptops some of the most reliable on the market. The solution required many prototypes and lots and lots of testing, similar to the design process, but the goal of creating hinges that would last five years (or opening and closing ten thousand times) was fixed, and his team tested many different mechanical solutions until they met their goal. **Once this goal was met, the solution could be reproduced millions of times. It was a good engineering problem.**\n\n“Compare this with the problem of designing the first laptop that had a ‘built in mouse’. Because Apple’s computers relied on the mouse to do almost everything, building a laptop that required you to be wired up to a regular mouse was unacceptable. **This was a design problem. There was no precedent to design toward, there was no fixed or predetermined outcome;** there were plenty of ideas floating around the lab, and a number of different designs were tested, but nothing was working. Then along came an engineer named Jon Krakower. Jon had been tinkering around with miniaturized trackballs, and had the crazy idea to push the keyboard to the back of the unit, leaving just enough room to squeeze in this tiny pointing device. This turned out to be the big breakthrough everyone had been looking for, and has been part of the signature look of Apple laptops ever since.\n\n“**When you have a desired outcome (a truly portable laptop computer) but no clear solution in sight, that’s when you brainstorm, try crazy stuff, improvise, and keep ‘building your way forward’ until you come up with something that works. You know it when you see it.** A great design comes together in a way that can’t be solved with equations and spreadsheets and data analysis. It has a look and feel all of its own - a beautiful aesthetic that speaks to you.”\n\n![Designing your life book image](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdesigning-your-life.5b832608.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis is one reason engineers new to system design can bomb their first couple of system design interviews spectacularly: They approach a design problem as if it’s an engineering problem. There is not a single “best” solution to a system design problem. There are no predetermined outcomes. The less code you write in a system design interview, the better.\n\nTo succeed in a system design interview, you want to collaborate with your interviewer, try crazy stuff, and try more crazy stuff until the design “feels right.”\n\n## How approaching a system design interview is different than a coding interview\n\n**The difference between coding and system design is the difference between retrieving and creating.**\n\nInstead of finding (or “retrieving”) a solution, you are creating a solution. In this way, coding is akin to a science, while system design is more like an art.\n\n![Depiction of analytical left brain and creative right brain](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fbrain-sides.ae49f6ed.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nHere’s another way to think about it. You aren’t solving a problem—you’re creating a map to help someone else find the solution. Instead of coloring inside some lines, you’ll need to draw the lines for someone else to color in. In a system design interview, there are no correct answers—though there are certainly incorrect ones—so there is nothing to solve. Instead, you’ll ask questions, make stuff, and explain how and why the stuff you made was reasonable.\n\n##### Don’t think like a coder. Think like a Tech Lead.\n\nDuring the interview, you’ll spend an hour playing the role of a Tech Lead, so just pretend that the interviewer is a junior engineer who will be implementing your design. Juniors will have lots of questions, and since you’re the Tech Lead, you want to welcome these questions.\n\n### Anecdote\n\n“Pretend it’s 1999, so a lot of the stuff we have access to today simply doesn’t exist. You and a group of your schoolmates are in your garage, hoping to make something. You're the most senior one there. You will design it and your friends will code it up, and the thing is: the Minimum Viable Product has to be completed by tomorrow. So, there’s no time to prep and no need to worry about the intricacies of system architecture that you don’t know. Just answer this: How would you design this system so your friends could code it up today, right now? It doesn’t have to be pretty. It doesn’t have to be complicated. It doesn’t have to impress anyone. It just has to get done.”\n\n##### What you do is important, but how you communicate is even more important.\n\nThe value of communication in coding interviews is controversial ([source](https://interviewing.io/blog/does-communication-matter-in-technical-interviewing-we-looked-at-100k-interviews-to-find-out)). But without communication in a system design interview, nothing happens. By necessity, it’s more conversational in nature than a coding interview and will have more back and forth between interviewer and candidate.\n\nWith that said, sometimes you’ll have an interviewer who is cold or not very collaborative. Dealing with these interviewers requires practice. The more senior you become, the more important it is to learn how to adjust your communication style to match your audience. We recommend completing mock interviews with a variety of interviewers to help you become a seasoned, fearless veteran of system design interviews.\n\n##### There are no optimal solutions in system design interviews.\n\nThere’s no “right” way to design a system. If two experts designed the same system, you would see two different designs, beautiful and aesthetic in their own way and both as “correct” as the other (and with the accompanying justifications to support them).\n\n### Tip\n\nIn [part 2](/guides/system-design-interview/part-two), two experts will show you how they would each design the same system, providing you with a practical lesson on this topic.\n\n##### Lean towards your strengths.\n\n### Anecdote\n\n“If you want to be a great interview candidate you’ve gotta know… It’s your responsibility to leave breadcrumbs for the interviewer to go where you want them to go. That way you have them walk you down the road where you are at your best. And then the Jedi mind trick is to get them to think it was their idea to get you there.”\n\nWhat if your measurement of success in an interview isn’t what you say, but instead it’s what you get the interviewer to say? Imagine you say something that engages the interviewer’s curiosity so much that they have no choice but to follow up with a “tell me more about that.” If the areas you get them to dig into the deepest, are things you’re good at: congratulations you are doing the Jedi mind trick.\n\nA candidate doing a system design interview will usually experience confusion. The interview format is so open-ended, you cannot know about everything they'll ask you. However, there will be opportunities to strut your stuff. There will be moments when they ask you about something you know very well, and when this happens put your shoulders back and flex your muscles on this topic.\n\n## What it’s like to walk into a system design interview\n\nWhen beginning an interview, try to imagine what the interviewer is looking for. What are their goals for the session? How can you help them achieve those goals in a way that persuades them that you’ll be a strong hire?\n\n**Put simply, the interviewer's goal is to find enough data to hire you.** Given the limited time available to them, an interviewer has to try to get enough positive signal about your ability so they can justify giving you a “hire” rating. In one hour you have to show your interviewer that you understand the fundamentals of a system (end to end). You also should be able to name and explain (at least at a high level) each part of the system, describe the tradeoffs you make, and find a solution.\n\n### Remember\n\nThe best way to accomplish this is to imagine that you’re explaining a design doc to a group of more junior engineers. They will ask you questions about your decisions and want to know what you’re trying to solve. Anticipating these questions and your responses will set you up for success in the interview.\n\n![Woman helping man code](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fpair-programming.ad187620.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nWant to know exactly what a FAANG System Design interviewer looks for? Get detailed feedback on your system design skills from our professional interviewers.\n\n[See available times](/signup)\n\n![](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcta.47351a0d.png&w=1200&q=75)\n\n## What your interviewer looks for, and what they don't\n\nWith this basic model in mind, let's consider the main elements that system design interviewers look for, and the elements that don’t matter.\n\n### What your interviewer wants to see\n\n1.  a broad, base-level understanding of system design fundamentals.\n2.  back-and-forth about problem constraints and parameters.\n3.  well-reasoned, qualified decisions based on engineering trade-offs.\n4.  the unique direction your experience and decisions take them.\n5.  a holistic view of a system and its users.\n\n### What your interviewer is not looking for\n\n1.  deep expertise in the given problem domain.\n2.  assumptions about the prompt.\n3.  specific answers with ironclad certainty.\n4.  a predefined path from the beginning to end of the problem.\n5.  strictly technical considerations.\n\n##### You do not need to display deep expertise in the given problem domain. Interviewers want to see that you have a broad, base-level understanding of system design fundamentals.\n\nYour interviewer will expect you to have knowledge of a wide range of basic topics, but they won't expect you to be an expert in any of them. For instance, you should understand the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, their broad performance characteristics, and the types of applications each might be useful for (which we’ll teach you later in this guide). But you would not need to know how the internals of either type of database work at any kind of detailed level.\n\nIn spite of this, you still might be asked to design those internals! Keep in mind, though, that your answer doesn't need to be optimal or reflect real-world implementations. For example, if an interviewer asks you to design a database/SQL query engine, they're not trying to discern if you're familiar with the academic literature on query engines or discover how much time you've spent working on database internals.\n\nInstead, they want to see how you would approach the problem based on what you do know, starting from first principles and collaborating with them. Your answer will probably not be anywhere near optimal, and that's OK! The interviewer will focus on the process, not the result.\n\n##### Interviewers want to engage you in a back-and-forth conversation about problem constraints and parameters, so avoid making assumptions about the prompt.\n\nInitial prompts to system design problems tend to be intentionally light on detail. Many candidates make a mistake by extrapolating details from the initial prompt and crafting a solution based on those assumptions.\n\nFor example, imagine that the interviewer instructs you to design a \"photo sharing service\" with some minimally defined capabilities. This may cause some candidates to imagine that they're rebuilding Instagram and start designing around the assumption that all images will be relatively small, not examined closely, and that extensive compression to save storage and bandwidth is acceptable.\n\nBut the interviewer didn’t tell you to rebuild Instagram, so you’ll need to keep in mind that there are many different types of photo sharing services. The interviewer may have had in mind something like Imgur or Photobucket, sites that cater more to basic image hosting for the web. Or they could be thinking about something like Flickr or 500px, services built for photographers to show off their work in high resolution.\n\nSo how do you figure out what type of service the interviewer wants you to build? Ask them! A basic prompt leaves room for you to start a conversation with your interviewer about the system you're designing—what type of users does it serve, what type of traffic can it expect, what limits will it have? Demonstrating that you can think critically about the parameters of your service is the first step in any system design interview.\n\n##### Interviewers are not looking for specific answers with ironclad certainty. They want to see well-reasoned, qualified decisions based on engineering trade-offs.\n\nBe very careful any time you find yourself responding immediately to a prompt in a system design interview. Even aspects of your design that seem insignificant need at least cursory consideration. Let’s use IDs as an example.\n\nA candidate will often start a discussion of a data model with a statement like, \"I'll use auto incrementing IDs,\" or \"I'll use GUID here\" as kind of a default approach to assigning IDs to data. In many applications, however, the type of ID you assign to your data has practical consequences.\n\nIs this ID going to be exposed to users? If so, how long does it need to be to avoid collisions? If we auto-increment it, are we worried about the visibility that will give third parties into our traffic patterns or the possibilities of users guessing the IDs to each others' data? If it's intended to be shared, is it convenient to type? If you print it on a business card or a flier, does it contain characters that you could confuse for each other (e.g., “1” and “I”, “0” and “O”)?\n\nYou don't need to hold an inquiry for every minor detail, but always be sure to give some justification for the decisions you make and let your interviewer know how your decisions would change in different circumstances. System design problems don't have a single definitive answer, so interviewers just want to see that you can justify your answers.\n\n##### Interviewers are not looking for a predefined path from the beginning to end of the problem. They want to see the unique direction your experience and decisions take them.\n\nCoding problems usually have an expected path. Typically you'll begin with an obvious but inefficient solution, and then the interviewer will prompt you for a series of improvements. Those improvements lead you to increasingly efficient solutions until you finally arrive at the optimal implementation.\n\n![Choose your own adventure books](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchoose-your-own-adventure.3a08d61b.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSystem design problems, on the other hand, resemble a Choose Your Own Adventure book rather than a linear novel. A complex system contains a multitude of sub-components, each one of which could serve as a design problem on its own. After you've sketched the overall layout of your system, an interviewer may decide to keep your focus on the big picture or dive into a deeper examination of one particular component.\n\nThe path your interview takes will be steered by your interviewer, but they're likely to take cues from the sub-problems in which you display interest or aptitude. In some cases they may explicitly ask you which part of the problem you'd prefer to focus on.\n\nEven if you're not choosing directly, you can still influence an interview's direction. As you talk your way through a solution, it’s OK to specifically note the parts that you have experience in and explain when you're making educated guesses. Your interviewer won't expect you to know everything, but giving them a better idea of what you do know will help them steer the interview in ways that reveal your strengths and problem-solving ability.\n\n##### Interviewers seek a holistic view of a system and its users.\n\nWhen faced with a choice in a design interview, it's easy to focus on the technical details, but remember that computer systems serve human users, so you’ll want to anchor your technical decisions to the user experience they enable.\n\nSuppose, for instance, that the image sharing service you're designing will require users to log in before uploading an image. In technical terms, you might want to avoid login to keep the database schema simpler, or you could introduce login to gather better metrics. An anonymous experience may be best for a public image-hosting site intended for quick turnaround and low interaction, while a logged-in experience offers the possibility of community features like commenting and sharing, personalized metrics, and the ability to restrict an upload to authorized viewers. You may want to take either approach or even both, allowing a limited anonymous experience with extra features for logged-in users.\n\nThe important thing is to discuss the possible approaches and their consequences for the user experience with your interviewer before making a decision. You can never go wrong by making the end user the driving force in your design.\n\n![Red flag and green flag](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fred-flag-green-flag.69295f3f.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n## Green Flags, Red Flags, and other signposts\n\nThink of red and green flags as signposts you can use to orient yourself in the interview. Green flags indicate that things are going well, that you're engaging with the interviewer and making a positive impression. Red flags warn you that you may be going astray and should try to get the interview back on track.\n\n### Red Flag #1: You believe that to pass a system design interview, you should just “play the game, keep talking, and make sure nobody explodes.”\n\nFollowing this quote’s advice has steered many interviewees in the wrong direction. There is no game, and talking for the sake of talking is one way to hang yourself with the rope the interviewer gives you. Also, if the goal is to not explode, well, you’re wasting your and your interviewer’s time.\n\n### Green Flag #1: You communicate honestly about what you know and what you don’t.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, this guide will teach you the basic information that you’ll be asked about in 80% of system design interviews. Although these are great odds, you still may encounter a scenario that’s beyond your level of understanding. If this happens to you, don’t worry! Just engage in an honest dialogue with your interviewer, explaining when you lack certain knowledge or have gaps in your understanding. When you do have a sense of how to proceed, but you’re uncertain, you should communicate from first principles. Later in this guide, we will explain how to overcome that uncertainty and still score points with your interviewer.\n\n### Red Flag #2: You find yourself pushing against interviewer feedback.\n\nKeep in mind that your interviewers use the same problems over and over again, and they frequently see candidates make the same mistakes. If they try to divert you from a course of action, it's likely because they've seen others flounder when using the same approach. You may be the one candidate in a hundred who finds a unique and better solution—we've had this happen before!—but carefully consider the odds before proceeding with a solution against the interviewer's advice.\n\nWith that said, there is an art to pushing back against your interviewer when the situation calls for it, and later in this guide we’ll teach you how and when to employ this strategy .\n\n### Green Flag #2: The interview feels like a collaboration between you and the interviewer.\n\nWhen the interviewer offers feedback, you integrate it into your design. You ask probing questions and receive useful answers about the system you're designing, its users, and its traffic. **Try to establish a tone as if you were working through a problem with a coworker rather than proving yourself to an interviewer.** In the real world, when you’re assigned a project, you’ll have to ask a variety of people several questions to ensure that you fully understand the problem before making decisions. That’s what interviewers want to see.\n\n### Red Flag #3: You skip over questions and ignore interviewer prompts, trying to move the interview ahead without addressing their concerns.\n\nIt's OK to not know things—no one will have every answer—but it's better to admit that to your interviewer than to avoid the questions altogether. Your interviewer may be able to offer you a hint or help you reason about alternatives if they know you're struggling, but if you skip right ahead you'll miss the opportunity to provide them with any positive signal from that portion.\n\n### Green Flag #3: Your role determines who should drive the focus and pace of the interview.\n\nIf you’re looking for a mid-level position or below, your interviewer should determine the direction and speed of the interview. Given an initial overview of your design, they may ask you for clarification on some aspects of it. They may ask you to produce a more detailed design for one or more components. And they may also change the requirements and ask how you could adapt your solution to accommodate this new view of the world. Wherever they take the interview, follow along and focus on the areas they direct you to.\n\nIf you’re applying for a senior role (or above), it’s a good sign if you direct more of the interview. In junior system design interviews, the interviewer expects to drive the interview, but as you reach senior levels the expectation shifts to the interviewee.\n\n### Anecdote from a seasoned interviewer\n\n​​Being overly confident and talking too much might count against a mid-level candidate. Some interviewers (especially off-script ones) love giving candidates more rope to hang themselves with, and then they ask specific questions that focus on what the candidate struggles with.\n\nIf your goal is to maximize a mid-level offer, not improve your \"average passing rate\" (i.e., if you are comfortable sacrificing some senior-plus chances to increase your mid-level chances), then you might be better off consciously \"giving control away\" to your interviewer.\n\nSimply put, at the above-senior level an awkward pause will be held against you—that’s basically guaranteed. But at mid-level, most of your attempts to fill in an awkward pause may hurt you more than keeping silent.\n\nAnother way to think of it: when you are not leading the conversation, you signal that you’re not really far above mid-level. (But if you are comfortable at mid-level, this is not a downside!)\n\nThe saying, ‘Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt’ can be true for mid-level interviews but not for seniors or above-senior.”\n\n### Red Flag #4: You leave long stretches (several minutes) of silence multiple times throughout the interview.\n\nIf you're struggling to provide an answer, give yourself a little bit of time to come up with something. If you're truly stuck, however, you should ask your interviewer for help. They can't tell that you're at an impasse unless you tell them, and you may waste valuable interview time while they debate whether it's been long enough to interrupt you.\n\n### Green Flag #4: You take time to collect your thoughts and refine solutions before offering them up out loud/on the board.\n\nAn interview doesn't need to be a continuous stream of consciousness, and it never hurts to sanity check your ideas before verbalizing them.\n\n### Tip\n\nIn Part 4 of this guide, we’ll teach you how to get unstuck and exactly what to say when you’re stuck.\n\n![Several road signs](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Froad-signs.c32a8e36.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### A few more signposts\n\n##### A common failure point occurs when candidates don’t make decisions\n\nOften, candidates will say things like: “we could use this type of DB, or this other, or that other, and these are some pros and cons…” and then they move on to another component. It’s a good practice to talk about benefits and tradeoffs, but then you have to make a decision. In the real world you have to make decisions—the same thing applies to the interview. If the interviewer challenges you with some questions, it’s totally fine to change your mind and alter the component (if you think there are better choices).\n\n### Don’t say\n\n![Thumbs down icon](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fthumbs-down.bfb29c8c.png&w=64&q=75)\n\nWe could use this type of DB, or this other, or that other, and these are some pros and cons…\n\n### Do say\n\n![Thumbs up icon](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fthumbs-up.c52eadb9.png&w=64&q=75)\n\n\"We could use this type of DB, or this other, or that other, and these are some pros and cons… **And based on all these tradeoffs, I’ll use THAT type of DB.**\"\n\n##### Interviewers want to identify “impostors”: people who just learned a few words and try to pass the interview.\n\n**Don’t say things because you think you’re supposed to say them.** This often occurs when candidates name specific brands of technologies (e.g., “Kafka” or “Cassandra”). Not being familiar with specific databases or other components is fine. Be smart and don’t say brand names just for the sake of saying them.\n\n### Don’t say\n\n![Thumbs down icon](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fthumbs-down.bfb29c8c.png&w=64&q=75)\n\nI’m going to use Cassandra...” unless you are VERY familiar with that, because the next question will be: “Why Cassandra and not some\\_other\\_db?\n\n### Do say\n\n![Thumbs up icon](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fthumbs-up.c52eadb9.png&w=64&q=75)\n\nI’m going to use a NoSQL db because of \\[insert brief rationale\\].\n\n### Don’t say\n\n![Thumbs down icon](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fthumbs-down.bfb29c8c.png&w=64&q=75)\n\nI will use Kafka…” unless you’re prepared to explain how Kafka works. Don’t say “I will use Kafka” unless you are prepared to talk about other types of queues, because they may ask you: “Oh, Kafka, interesting choice. Why that instead of \\[some other queue\\]?\n\n### Do say\n\n![Thumbs up icon](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fthumbs-up.c52eadb9.png&w=64&q=75)\n\nI will use a queue because of \\[insert brief rationale\\].\n\n### Remember\n\nSay the generic name of the component, not the brand name unless you are very familiar with it. Don’t say Kafka. Instead, say “a queue.\n\nYou finished Part 1! We hope you gained a basic understanding of the system design interview and learned some tips and tricks you can use to excel in it. As you continue reading Parts 2-4, these “glimmers” of understanding will become more and more the default system of your interviewing skills.\n\nIn Part 2 we’ll teach you the 15 fundamental system design concepts. You’ll also get to watch our long form video of two system design experts designing the same system. They’re tasked with designing interviewing.io, which in this challenge is actually three systems in one: “Design google docs, a remote compiler, and a recording service… in 30 minutes or less.”\n\n[Part 2: 15 fundamental system...\n\n](/guides/system-design-interview/part-two)\n\n#### Credits\n\n###### Creator and author\n\nKevin Landucci\n\n###### Contributing authors\n\nAyush Bagla\n\nMartin Copes\n\nDima Korolev\n\nFrank (Haolun) Li\n\nMichael Mroczka\n\n###### Core consultants\n\nBruno Albuquerque\n\nAdam Bhula\n\nGrace Shea\n\n###### Technical reviewer\n\nGithire (Brian) Wahome\n\n###### Additional consultants\n\nBret Funk\n\nKyle Pacia\n\nJosh Thompson\n\n###### Editor\n\nAline Lerner\n\n###### Special thanks\n\nAll of the wonderful interviewers whom we’re not allowed to name 🙃\n\n## We know exactly what to do and say to get the company, title, and salary you want.\n\nInterview prep and job hunting are chaos and pain.

FAANG Interviews\n    \n\nThere are lots of guides out there to FAANG interview processes. **This one is the most thorough and the most detailed because it’s the only one made _by interviewers for candidates_ – we spent hundreds of hours talking to dozens of current and former FAANG interviewers about their processes**. Throughout this guide, you’ll see a bunch of direct quotes from these interviewers, where they describe the idiosyncrasies of each company’s process and bar in their own words. We’re fortunate to have them in the interviewing.io community, and we’re lucky that we can collaborate with them on this type of content. As you can imagine, they all requested to stay anonymous, but we want to thank them here, first and foremost.\n\n## Introduction to FAANG interviews\n\n![Introduction to FAANG interviews](/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fguides%2Fhiring-process%2Fdont-panic.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nFAANG interviews are a gauntlet, but you can pass them even if you doubt yourself – interviewing is easier once you learn a company’s operating metaphor. George Lakoff (neuroscience and artificial Intelligence researcher) says that every human organization has a metaphor they operate as. If you ask an employee at a FAANG company about their metaphor, you’ll probably receive a blank stare in return. But if you look at the interviewing data of that same FAANG company, the metaphors jump out of the data set like bread out of a toaster.\n\nThis guide will walk you through all the FAANGs’ metaphors and the unwritten codes of those metaphors: what they reward, what they punish, and what they’re blind to. To show them you’re obviously a part of their tribe, model their metaphors and unwritten codes.\n\nMetaphors aside, this guide will also walk you through the unglamorous logistics of every FAANG’s interview process so that you know how many steps there are, what those steps entail, and what kinds of questions they ask. Our goal is to have you walk in and be completely unfazed by the proceedings because you’re expecting them.\n\nOf course, even with all the insider info in the world, if you’re not prepared for technical interviews, you will fail, so we’d be remiss if we didn’t share some useful insights about practice to help you on your journey.\n\n## About this guide\n\nThere are 3 steps to getting a strong offer at FAANG.\n\n*   Step 1: Get Interview.\n*   Step 2: Do Interview.\n*   Step 3: Negotiate.\n\nSteps 1 and 3 are out of scope for this post, which is solely focused on Step 2.\n\nMoreover, this guide is written for experienced, back-end leaning engineers – interview processes are usually different for juniors, but we won’t be getting into those differences. Finally, we won’t be getting into the differences in process for front-end engineers, SREs, etc. That said, if you’re targeting those roles, you’ll still get value out of this guide.\n\nIn Part 1 of this guide, we’ll highlight key similarities and differences between the FAANG companies, namely:\n\n*   Meta\n*   Apple\n*   Amazon\n*   Netflix\n*   Google\n*   Microsoft (they’re not officially FAANG, but we’re including them anyway – from now on, when we say “FAANG”, we mean Microsoft as well)\n\nIn Part 2, we’ll go through each company one by one and tell you how each of their processes work and how to prepare for each one.\n\nIf you’re planning on interviewing with multiple FAANGS, we recommend reading Part 1 first. If you'd prefer to skip straight to a company’s individual guide then just click on it in the table of contents to the left! Individual guides include more detailed information on company-specific coding interviews, behavioral interviews, and anecdotes from actual interview experiences.\n\nAll of these big tech companies share grueling interview processes, strong initial compensation packages, and above average benefits. They compete with each other for the same engineers. If tech has a food chain, they’re at the top. Most other tech companies copy or are influenced by what FAANG does.\n\nThere are also a number of myths about FAANG interview processes. Two big ones are that Amazon has the lowest bar, and Google has the highest bar. That’s not true; we have the data. The reality is that all of their bars are different. It’s not a linear comparison. It’s a multidimensional comparison. Because of that, it’s impossible to say something like, “The entire process at Google is harder than the entire process at Amazon.” They’re simply different processes.\n\n#### Anecdote from a Facebook Interviewer\n\n“My friend interviewed at Google and Facebook, and he passed both loops. At Google, he was offered L6. At Facebook, he was offered L4. Speaking about luck: this is the same person with the same experience. And the level of difference– at two of the most trusted names in tech–was two levels of seniority.\n\nAnd one common idea in big tech is that Google’s process is easier than Facebook’s. But you can see here: it really depends. After all, this person accepted the L4 role at Facebook because the compensation package was bigger than the role at Google for L6.”\n\nLong story short: it’s complicated. That’s exactly why we wrote this guide: to demystify the differences, to decouple the 6-headed monster, and to demonstrate how to attack each head, one at a time.\n\n## 3 tips for FAANG interview success\n\nThis is the ultimate insider’s guide to tech interviews at FAANG. However, even with all the insider info in the world, if you’re not prepared for technical interviews, you will fail, so we’d be remiss if we didn’t share some useful insights about practice to help you on your journey. Yes, we know we’re a practice platform, and, look, you don’t have to practice with us. But you should practice! Here’s why.\n\n### 1\\. Do five practice interviews\n\nThree different startups with robust data sets on software engineering interviews found eerily similar data points about what happens after you do five technical interviews. I worked at all three companies and saw this data myself.\n\n*   In a previous article about [how to know when you're ready to interview at FAANG](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-know-ready-interview-faang) we shared that completing 5 technical interviews (mock interviews or real) doubles your chances of passing a subsequent technical interview.\n*   Triplebyte found that the chances of getting _at least 1 offer_ increases with each onsite you do, up until 5 onsites. For each onsite completed after the 5th, your chances of getting an offer level off at 80-85%.\n*   Pathrise found that most of their engineers failed 4-5 onsites before they got an offer.\n\nMind you, these datasets were quite different: Triplebyte skewed towards folks with nontraditional backgrounds, interviewing.io inclined towards senior backend engineers, and Pathrise was mainly junior engineers. Despite that, the number five emerged across these data sets, and it’s clear that something happens after you complete five technical interviews. We can’t explain what yet. But the data is screaming in all caps: there is a there _there_. One more anecdotal point: these five interviews should ideally mimic the real thing as much as possible. For instance, if you want a FAANG job, but your five interviews are with startups that don’t ask algorithmic questions, you won’t get as much value. The more your practice can simulate the real game, the better.\n\n### 2\\. If you’re unprepared, it’s OK to reschedule\n\nIf you’re unprepared for a FAANG interview, ask to reschedule. **Not rescheduling is the number one mistake we see our users make!** Getting an interview tomorrow (as opposed to 1-3 months from tomorrow) is, in most cases, no different to the company… but very different to you – if you fail, you might get frozen out for months. In the rare cases where rescheduling could hurt your chances because it’s a specific role for a specific team, your recruiter will tell you that. Either way, there’s no harm in asking.\n\n### 3\\. A note about recruiter calls\n\nRecruiter calls don’t differ much from FAANG company to FAANG company, so we decided to put everything about what to expect in a recruiter call in one place. If a recruiter call ever meaningfully deviates from this format, we’ll mention it. Otherwise, expect that it doesn’t.\n\nA recruiter call is the first step of almost every process. In this call, a recruiter will ask you about your past experience, your salary expectations, and why you’re interested in that particular company. They will also ask you about your timeline (how soon you expect to accept an offer), how far along you are with other companies, whether you have outstanding offers, and so on.\n\nIn this call, it’s important to be able to succinctly talk about your past few positions, your major contributions at those positions (what did you do individually versus what did your team do) and their impact on the business. Remember that most recruiters don’t have a technical background and they’re not software developers, so it’s important to be able to describe your technical contributions in clear layman’s terms.\n\nIt’s also really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a detailed [post about salary negotiation](https://interviewing.io/blog/negotiate-salary-recruiter) that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number. Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.\n\n# Part 1. Differences between the FAANGs\n\n## The Chaos Score\n\nThis section will give you a feel for how these companies’ processes differ. For now, don’t worry about how that translates into interview prep – we’ll cover that later when we describe how to prepare for each company.\n\nTake a look at the chart below. In it, we rank the FAANGs on their “Chaos Score”. The more points a company has, the more chaotic they are.\n\nIn this context, we define “chaos” as the level of uncertainty and unpredictability that candidates can expect from the interview process and its outcomes. If a company consistently follows the same process, asks the same questions, and thoroughly trains their interviewers, they are not chaotic. If their process is completely non-standard, non-deterministic and subjective, they are chaotic.\n\n| Company Name | Chaos Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| Apple | 20 |\n| Netflix | 20 |\n| Microsoft | 18 |\n| Amazon | 12 |\n| Google | 10 |\n| Meta | 3 |\n\nAs you can see, Apple and Netflix win the award for the most chaotic interview processes in FAANG. Microsoft gets 2nd place. Amazon gets 3rd, Google 4th, and Facebook 5th.\n\nChaos can be pain or pleasure depending on your tolerance for uncertainty. Chaos can also either impose a terrible detriment or prove a huge advantage in interviews specifically. For instance, candidates who have spent a long time grinding on LeetCode might prefer less chaotic companies. More chaotic companies can work for candidates for a few reasons: a) niche skill sets can be an easier match for niche interview processes, b) practical interviews are more likely, and c) the interview process shows them how the team they’d be joining actually operates.\n\n### How we calculated the Chaos Score for each company\n\nTo calculate each company’s Chaos Score, we picked four categories and graded each company on a 0 to 5 point scale in each category, where 5 means most chaotic and 0 means least.\n\n1.  The “north star” of their decision-making process (do they care more about “What”, “Why”, or “How”?)\n2.  If they have the same interviews company-wide or if the interview changes depending on the team with which you’re interviewing\n3.  How much they train their interviewers\n4.  How much they standardize their interview questions\n\nWe added up the points for each company, with a maximum possible Chaos Score of 20.\n\n### Deep dive into the FAANG Chaos Scores\n\n|  | North star | Team dependent process? | Level of training for interviewers? | Level of standardization? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Apple | Why (5) | Yes (5) | None (5) | None (5) |\n| Netflix | Why (5) | Yes (5) | None (5) | None (5) |\n| Microsoft | How (3) | Yes (5) | None (5) | None (5) |\n| Amazon | What (1) | Yes (5) | High (2) | Low (4) |\n| Google | How (3) | No (0) | Medium (3) | Low (4) |\n| Facebook | What (1) | No (0) | Highest (1) | Highest (1) |The more points a company has for each category, the more chaotic they are.\n\n#### The north star: “What”, “Why”, and “How” companies\n\nBy “North star”, we mean what a given company values most. As such, we grouped companies into 3 buckets: companies who primarily care about \"Why\", \"How\", and \"What\".\n\n“Why” is the most chaotic because judging motivations is the most subjective approach. “How” is the second most chaotic because judging thought processes is the second most subjective. “What” is the least chaotic because judging end results is the least subjective method.\n\n“Why” companies can’t agree on what a good “why” looks like because it’s a “gut feel / friend test”. Whom you consider to be a friend and who gives you a good gut feeling isn’t quantifiable. It’s completely subjective. “Why” companies are the most prone to bias. If you speak their language and model the behaviors they encourage, you’ll seem like a friend and give them a good gut feel. If you don’t, then you won’t.\n\nIf chaos is hell, then “Why” companies are raising hell for candidates and themselves.\n\n“How” companies mainly care about your thought process: _Okay, you didn’t get to the optimal solution, but what was the journey like_? Google and Microsoft repeat this mantra again and again – they want to know how you think. You might get asked a really hard or specific question, but they don’t necessarily require an optimal answer to pass. They put far more weight on your ability to demonstrate a solid thought process.\n\n“What” companies mainly care about your results, such as: _Did you get to the optimal solution_? Facebook and Amazon want you to get there, and fast. “What” is the most straightforward for candidates: simply get results as quickly as possible.\n\n#### Team-dependent process\n\nA Google or Facebook interview doesn’t change depending on the team you’re interviewing for. Both companies have one big, centralized interview process that’s completely divorced from which team you might end up on. If you do well in the team-agnostic process, there will be a team matching component after the onsite. You will NOT, however, be interviewing with your future coworkers.\n\n(Note: Google is rumored to be changing to a team-dependent process, but we’ll leave that where it is for now.)\n\nAt Microsoft, Netflix, Apple, and Amazon, the process is team-dependent. You’ll not only be interviewing with the people that you’ll be working with, but there’s more chaos. Each team defines how they do things: the types of questions asked, the types of interview rounds, and even how they make hiring decisions.\n\nTeam-dependent processes are more challenging in the sense that _you're more likely to get blind-sided_; because each team has a different process, candidates are more likely to prep for X and get (a significantly different) Y.\n\nYet, team-independent processes are more challenging _because of the machinery_. Your interviewers are so far removed from you. That detachment affects how they treat, judge, and talk about you.\n\n**Think of it like this: At Netflix, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft you’re interviewing with humans. At Google and Facebook, you’re interviewing with a machine.**\n\n#### Interviewer training\n\nFacebook is the least chaotic company in this category because they have the most in-depth interviewer training in FAANG. Their process is rigorous and selective. Though most would-be interviewers pass within 6 months, some people who try never pass the bar to become an interviewer. Facebook is the only FAANG where this is true.\n\nFacebook and Amazon put interviewer candidates through roughly the same things, but Facebook is more rigorous. For example, both will have similar modules interviewers go through in training. A module at Amazon is more likely to be a box to check: if you do it, you pass. At Facebook, you don’t pass simply for doing it: you pass by meeting a predetermined bar. Also, Facebook modules are more likely to have a rubric.\n\nGoogle used to have a more in-depth interviewer training process than what they have now. For whatever reason, they began to skimp on their interviewer training roughly sometime in the 2010s. Now, Googlers can get a bit of training, but usually not as much as folks at Facebook or Amazon.\n\nNetflix, Microsoft, and Apple do not train their interviewers; certain teams may be exceptions but there’s no company-wide required interview training. The day you start, you can start interviewing. That makes them the most chaotic in this category.\n\n**What this means for candidates is that the less training they put their interviewers through, the more likely you’ll have a bad interviewer. As the old saying goes: “Prepare for the worst, pray for the best.”**\n\n#### Interview question standardization\n\nCompanies that standardize their interview questions give interviewers less free reign; groups with no standardization have more free reign. At all companies, there will be interviewers who go rogue and deviate from the norm. Yet, each company has a norm.\n\nFacebook wins again for being the least chaotic/most predictable. In behavioral rounds, interviewers at Facebook can ask whatever behavioral questions they want. However, in technical rounds, they can only ask pre-approved coding questions. They can also modify pre-approved coding challenges. That’s it.\n\nGoogle is tied for the second least chaotic here; their interviewers have free reign in technical rounds. They have a large technical question bank, yet interviewers routinely make up their own ambiguous one-of-a-kind questions. In behavioral rounds, they can only ask or modify pre-approved questions.\n\nAmazon is tied for second least chaotic, but for a different reason. Technically, there’s no standardization for any round (technical or behavioral). They do, however, tend to repeat questions from their internal question bank (which is not required for interviewers to use.)\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Netflix are the most chaotic companies. Each team decides what to ask. Questions tend to be customized to the hiring manager’s preferences, a senior individual contributor’s diligence, what this team works on day-to-day, or the specific domain this team is in.\n\n## Which FAANGs let you interview with different teams simultaneously?\n\nWhether you get one shot or unlimited shots to land an offer changes how you prepare. Here’s the breakdown of which companies let you interview with multiple teams concurrently.\n\n| Company Name | Can interview with different teams concurrently? |\n| --- | --- |\n| Apple | Yes |\n| Netflix | Yes |\n| Microsoft | Yes |\n| Amazon | Yes |\n| Google | No |\n| Meta | No |\n\nIf you can interview with multiple teams concurrently, then they don’t have a cool down period. So, after you fail, you don’t need to wait at all to reinterview. Two of the biggest players only give you one shot to win, and at the remaining four your chances are unlimited.\n\n**Because their interview process is centralized, Google and Facebook are the only ones well-organized enough to not let candidates “double dip”.**\n\n#### Tip to get unstuck\n\nIf you really want a job at Netflix, Apple, Amazon, or Microsoft: stack the odds of landing your dream job in your favor and interview with multiple teams. There’s no cool-down period, so if you get rejected from Team A, you can interview with Team B tomorrow.\n\nIn Part 2, we’ll give you a deeper feel for each company, and we’ll tell you what to do about it. Each company has its own section, and each section is organized into five subsections:\n\n1.  Interview process (including what to expect in the recruiter call and the phone screen)\n2.  What to expect in your interviews\n3.  How they make hiring decisions\n4.

      "title": "In Defense of Coding Interviews",
      "content": "A collection of arguments in favor of coding interviews.\n\n# In Defense of Coding Interviews\n\nApril 16, 2025\n\n![In Defense of Coding Interviews](/blog/in-defense-of-coding-interviews/cover.png)\n\nThere is already a lot of discourse about everything wrong with coding interviews. Indeed, one of the first chapters in _Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview_ is _What's Broken About Coding Interviews?_ (it's one of the sneak peek free chapters in [bctci.co/free-chapters](https://bctci.co/free-chapters)).\n\nHere, I want to **collect all the arguments for the contrary view: that there are no clear better alternatives to coding interviews at Big Tech companies.**\n\n**Disclaimers:**\n\n*   I am one of the authors of _Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview_, a prep book for coding interviews. Thus, I am vested in coding interviews not going away.\n*   I love leetcoding and specialized in DS&A for my PhD, so I haven't personally experienced the _dread_ that most people feel grinding it.\n*   I've been an interviewer at Google in the past, but I'm not currently working for Big Tech, and I don't have any inside knowledge. This is just my assessment.\n*   This post is only about Big Tech. I don't think coding interviews are a good idea for startups.\n*   This post contains \"Strong Opinions, Weakly Held\". I believe everything here, but I'm very receptive to pushback and opposing data.\n\n## The rationale for coding interviews\n\nI think Big Tech companies understand that being cracked at DS&A is not really necessary to be a good SWE. I don't think coding interviews are about that at all.\n\nImagine you are a Big Tech company, like Google. You receive a massive stream of applications, and you have to trim that down to a still large number of hires. Your hiring system needs to be _scalable_:\n\n*   you need to quickly train many interviewers\n*   you need a way to evaluate candidates that minimizes interviewer bias (not _your_ bias, or a specific person's bias, but all the biases of a large, heterogeneous group)\n\nSo, the first thing you do to scale--in true engineering fashion--is decoupling hiring and team matching. But that means you cannot hire for specific tech or domain experience: You don't know in what team candidates will end up, and your teams use a bunch of different languages and tech stacks (and a lot of it is internal anyway, so you definitely can't hire for that).\n\nSo, you need a _competence assessment_ that is independent of any particulars about the job, much like the role the SAT plays for college admissions. How do you do that?\n\nIf you are a Big Tech company, what you actually want is candidates who can take any complex software system (that's not part of the candidate's previous expertise) and answer hard questions about it, like what's the best way to add a feature, how to optimize it, or how it should be refactored. In other words, the competence you want to assess is general problem-solving skills, and that's what coding interviews are designed for: you are given a tough problem that you have _ideally_ never seen before (more on this later), and asked to showcase your thought process on how you approach it. When working as intended, I believe it gives more _signal_ about your problem-solving skills and is easier to evaluate impartially than other popular interview formats, like talking about previous experience or take-home assignments. And there's an impartial way to evaluate them, by looking at the optimality of the solution.\n\nYes, there's a lot more to being a SWE than problem-solving skills--and that's why Google also does system design and behavioral interviews, but you still want to hire for this trait.\n\n## The two crucial flaws: memorization and cheating\n\nHopefully, the rationale above covered one of the most common criticisms of coding interviews: that they do not reflect the day-to-day work of an engineer. Instead, I want to focus on what _I_ think are the two biggest issues with coding interviews:\n\n1.  **Memorizing an absurd amount of leetcode problems gives you an edge.** This is the classic reason why people [_hate_](https://www.teamblind.com/post/We-wrote-the-official-sequel-to-Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-AMA-sosHtL28/44294147?commentsSort=top) coding interviews with a passion. It has led to an \"arms race\" where candidates have to memorize more and more problems to improve their odds, and interviewers keep asking about more niche topics. At the extreme, coding interviews end up feeling like a lottery, and candidates find prep a soul-sucking waste of time.\n    \n2.  **Cheating has become easy with AI.** This is a newer issue that's becoming more prevalent due to the fact that LLMs are pretty good at leetcoding. In real time, a cheater can feed the problem statement to an LLM (without obvious tales like \"select all\"), get a solution, and even a script for what to say.\n    \n\nFrom the company's side, Issue (1) is not much of an issue. It definitely undermines the \"problem-solving\" part of the interview if a candidate is just recalling the question, but, statistically, if they do enough rounds, it's unlikely to happen every round. Some people (not me) also argue that the memorization is even good for the companies because it rewards hard work and dedication.\n\nFor what it's worth, one thing we hoped to change about the interview prep discourse with BCtCI is that candidates should focus on improving their problem-solving skills rather than memorizing. See, for instance, how we [teach binary search](https://nilmamano.com/blog/binary-search) or how we [approach hard problems](https://nilmamano.com/blog/problem-solving-bctci-style). But yes, grinding is still necessary.\n\nIssue (1) also means that they'll lose a big chunk of candidates who are great SWEs but won't put up with grinding leetcode or that simply don't perform well under pressure (and, from personal experience, many great developers fall in this group). This sucks from the candidate's perspective, but if you are Google, you receive an overwhelming amount of applications from qualified candidates, so you are more OK with rejecting good candidates than accepting bad ones.\n\nIssue (2), on the other hand, has the potential to completely ruin coding interviews from the company's side. I'm seeing a quick rise of stories from frustrated interviewers who interviewed or even hired cheaters who could then not do the job (Exhibit [A](https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1joh0w1/interview_coder_ai_is_a_complete_scam_and_total/)).\n\nI expect to see some kind of systematic response to this from Big Tech, but it's not clear what as of April 2025. [This article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/09/google-ai-interview-coder-cheat.html) includes some internal comments from Google execs:\n\n> \\[Brian\\] Ong \\[Google’s vice president of recruiting\\] said candidates and Google employees have said they prefer virtual job interviews because scheduling a video call is easier than finding a time to meet in available conference rooms. The virtual interview process is about two weeks faster, he added.\n> \n> He said interviewers are instructed to probe candidates on their answers as a way to decipher whether they actually know what they’re talking about.\n> \n> “We definitely have more work to do to integrate how AI is now more prevalent in the interview process,” said Ong. He said his recruiting organization is working with Google’s software engineer steering committee to figure out how the company can refine its interviewing process.\n> \n> “Given we all work hybrid, I think it’s worth thinking about some fraction of the interviews being in person,” Pichai responded. “I think it’ll help both the candidates understand Google’s culture and I think it’s good for both sides.”\n\nI thought going back to in-person interviews would be a _no-brainer_ for a company like Google, but my reading of these comments is that they don't seem too bothered for now. ~shrug~\n\nDisclaimer: I haven't worked for a Big Tech company since before AI cheating went viral, so I don't have internal insight into what people in charge of hiring are actually thinking.\n\nTwo related arguments that I don't subscribe to are (1) that leetcode-style interviews are no longer relevant because AI can solve them, and (2) that LLMs should be allowed during coding interviews because they are allowed on the job. The fact that AI can solve coding questions doesn't change that it still gives you the important signal that you want from humans: algorithmic thinking and general problem-solving skills. We just need humans to not cheat.\n\nI'll share my thoughts on how to improve coding interviews to address these issues. First, let's see why I think the alternatives are not better.\n\n## The problems with the alternatives\n\n### Take-home assignments\n\nTake-home assignments are even more subject to cheating, so that can't be the answer to cheating. Never mind LLMs, you don't even know who did the assignment. But take-home assignments have other flaws:\n\n*   They create an asymmetry between company and candidate, where the company asks for a ton of work from the candidate without putting any effort in. \"Oh, we have way too many candidates we need to filter down to a shortlist? Send all of them a complex task to do over the weekend.\" I prefer a model where both company and candidate have to put in time. I'm more OK with take-home assignments as the final stage of the process.\n*   They favor people who are unemployed and/or have a lot of free time to polish the assignment.\n\n### Previous experience\n\nI find this too subjective to give signal about problem-solving skills, and it's more about being a good \"salesperson\". I also think it's more subject to bias: _people with a similar background as yours are probably more likely to have similar interests, and thus you may find their side-projects more interesting._\n\n## Trial periods\n\nThis makes sense to me in smaller companies, where you find a candidate with the perfect profile for the task at hand. It doesn't scale to Big Tech companies.\n\n### Other alternatives\n\nIf there are other alternatives that fulfill the same purpose as coding interviews but don't suffer from the same issues, I'd love to hear about them.\n\nOne idea I liked is going through a code review during the interview, but it's not clear that (1) it offers as much signal about problem-solving skills, and (2) it is easy to evaluate impartially.\n\n## How to improve coding interviews\n\nRight now, FAANG interviewers focus too much on \"Did they solve the question or not?\" That's because they don't get much training on how to interview well (if at all), and it's the most straightforward way to pass on a hire/no hire recommendation to the hiring committee. This leads to many interviewers just pasting the prompt in and mostly sitting in silence. This is the ideal scenario for cheaters.\n\n### The obvious things\n\nThere are obvious ways to improve this situation:\n\n*   In-person interviews. These have other benefits, like allowing the candidate to get a better sense of the company culture.\n*   Not using publicly available questions, and actively scanning for leaks.\n*   Cheating detection software (privacy is a concern here -- would it be too crazy for a company to ship a laptop to the candidate just for the interview?).\n*   Stop asking questions that require knowing some niche trick that a normal person wouldn't be able to figure out on the spot. Those reinforce a focus on memorization.\n\n### Low effort ways of countering cheating\n\nI also think that measures designed to throw LLMs off could be effective (at least in the short term) and require minimal effort, such as:\n\n*   Stating the question, or part of it, instead of writing the whole thing down\n*   Including a 'decoy' question and telling the candidate, \"Ignore that line, it is part of our anti-cheating measures.\"\n\nSee [LinkedIn discussion](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nilmamano_if-coding-interview-cheating-is-a-big-issue-activity-7306108316126957569-3Pgy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC6jqIwBADV70xmTEpmkxbAnN_32mssoxA8).\n\n### A fundamental tradeoff\n\nPerhaps the most effective way to counter both memorization and cheating is to make coding interviews more open ended and conversational. To use a chess analogy, a cheater may make a great move, but if you ask them to explain why they did it, they may not be able to.\n\nThe interviewer can use a coding question as a launching point, but then drill down on technical topics as they come up. So, e.g., if a candidate chooses to use a heap, the interviewer could go into:\n\n*   What made you think of using a heap? What properties are important for this problem?\n*   What are the tradeoffs of using a heap vs binary search trees?\n*   How would you go about implementing a heap that supports arbitrary priorities?\n*   Why is [heapify faster than inserting one by one](https://nilmamano.com/blog/heapify-analysis)?\n\nIf interviewers did that, it wouldn't even be necessary to ask tricky questions. They could even [ask _Fibonacci_](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chrisverges_here-are-my-interview-questions-for-a-software-activity-7259700112145158144-YqnR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC6jqIwBADV70xmTEpmkxbAnN_32mssoxA8).\n\nThe problem is that, the more open ended the interview is, the more difficult it is to evaluate candidates systematically. To start, you'd need better interviewers and better interviewer training. However, it seems to me that there is **a fundamental tradeoff between how objective the evaluation is and how _gameable_ the interview is by memorizing or cheating.**\n\nI don't have a good solution to this--I would love to hear yours.\n\n## More good things about coding interviews\n\n### Only one thing to study\n\nAn underrated upside of leetcode interviews is that you only need to study one thing for all the big companies. I feel like if every company asked different things, interview prep time would decrease for any specific company but increase overall.\n\nIn fact, a likely outcome of the push for fewer leetcode-style interviews is an even worse compromise: coding interviews won't completely go away, so you'll still need to grind leetcode, but you'll also have to prep a bunch of specialized stuff for each company on top of that.\n\nSee [LinkedIn discussion](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nilmamano_an-underrated-upside-of-leetcode-interviews-activity-7312845744674091010-K0EU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC6jqIwBADV70xmTEpmkxbAnN_32mssoxA8).\n\n### They are not based on pedigree\n\nCoding interviews act as a form of standardized testing, similar to the role of SAT for college admissions in the US. And, much like the SAT allows high-school students from all backgrounds to attend top colleges, coding interviews allow candidates from all backgrounds to get at the top companies. The leetcode grind is the same for everyone.\n\nIf we kill coding interviews without a good alternative, it seems inevitable that Big Tech companies will give more weight to resume and referrals. We all agree that's a bad thing.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nThe best question we got in our [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1j4zsjj/we_wrote_the_official_sequel_to_ctci_cracking_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for BCtCI was whether [we'd use coding interviews ourselves if we were in charge of hiring](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1j4zsjj/comment/mgdfddt/). You can see Gayle's, Mike's ([mikemroczka.com](https://www.mikemroczka.com/)), and my answers. We all said _no_ in its current form, but yes with caveats/improvements.\n\nMy favorite answer was Mike's. He's less of a proponent of leetcode-style interviews than I am, but I think he strikes a thoughtful balance between DS&A and practical stuff:\n\n> Best question so far. Yes, I would ask DS&A questions still, but not exclusively and not difficult ones. Many startups shouldn't ask them though, because most people are bad at discerning what a reasonable question is.\n> \n> I would do 4-5 rounds of interviews because less than that is hard to be significant, but more than that and you're wasting too much of a candidate's time (Netflix has a whopping 8 rounds!!). For a senior engineer role, I'd do something like this.\n> \n> Round 1: An online DS&A assessment to filter out people that can't do the simple things (easy & very simple medium questions only, not hard)\n> \n> Round 2: Live interview of DS&A (simple medium, not hard. essentially just making sure you didn't cheat on the previous round by asking you to explain your answers and code something new from scratch)\n> \n> Round 3: System design (no need for perfect answers, but I'd ask an uncommon question to ensure it was something they hadn't memorized)\n> \n> Round 4: Behavioral, with a focus on cross-team impact. This would just be a simple pass/fail and just a vibe check. It might also be skipped if the prior two rounds had good signal for emotional intelligence\n> \n> Round 5: Remote logging into a server and working on an actual bug that was fixed in our codebase before. There would be no time limit, but time on the server would be logged to weed people out who needed days to complete a simple task.\n> \n> This ends up testing a little bit of theory, practical knowledge, emotional intelligence, and the generalized SWE skillset.\n> \n> Full disclosure. This is my answer. Not the answer of every author. Again, I'd stress that the average startup wouldn't benefit from DS&A and shouldn't be asking them\n\n_Want to leave a comment?

      "content": "A binary search recipe that works for every problem, explained without code.\n\n# Get Binary Search Right Every Time, Explained Without Code\n\nApril 15, 2025\n\n![Get Binary Search Right Every Time, Explained Without Code](/blog/binary-search/cover.png)\n\nOne of the things that makes binary search tricky to implement is that you usually need to tweak the pointer manipulation logic in subtle ways based on the specifics of the problem.\n\nE.g., an implementation that works for finding a target in a sorted array when the target is present, may not work if the target is missing. Or, it may not be clear how to tweak the code to find the last occurrence of the target instead of the first one. And of course, there are plenty of less conventional applications of binary search where the input is not an array, like [catching bike thieves](https://x.com/AlecStapp/status/1728953538301345889).\n\nIn [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X), we wanted to simplify this, so we went looking for a general binary search template. Going into it, I thought we might need at least two templates, but we ended up with just one, which we called the \"transition point recipe\", and which works for every problem we tried, including the 17 problems in the binary search chapter of the book. If you find one where it doesn't work, let me know!\n\n## The transition point problem\n\nHere is the thesis of the transition point recipe:\n\nEvery binary search problem can be reduced to the 'transition point problem'.\n\nIn the 'transition point problem', you are given an array with just two values, say `1` and `2`, where all the `1`s come before the `2`s, and you need to point where it changes.\n\nE.g., in the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`, the last `1` is at index `4` and the first `2` is at index `5`.\n\nKnowing how to solve this specific problem is key to our recipe. The specific binary search implementation is not important, but there is an invariant we can follow that makes it quite easy: ensure that the left pointer is always at a `1` and the right pointer is always at a `2`.\n\nWe give code in the book, but remembering exact code in an interview is error prone. Instead, the four bullet points below are all I _personally_ remember, and I feel confident that I can derive the rest easily.\n\n1.  Start by handling some edge cases:\n    *   The array is empty\n    *   Every value is `1`\n    *   Every value is `2`\n2.  Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the first and last indices, respectively.\n3.  For the main binary search loop, always maintain the _invariant_ that the value at `left` is `1` and the value at `right` is `2`. Let this invariant guide your pointer manipulation logic, so that you don't need to memorize any code.\n4.  Stop when the `left` and `right` pointers are next to each other (i.e., `left + 1 == right`).\n\nCombining the invariant with the stopping condition, we get that, at the end, `left` will be at the last `1` and `right` will be at the first `2`.\n\nThese bullet points rely on two ideas to make binary search easier: (1) handling edge cases upfront, and (2) letting strong invariants guide the implementation. Notice how the invariant even guides the edge cases at the beginning, as they are the necessary ones to be able to initialize `left` and `right` in a way that satisfies it.\n\n## The reduction\n\nOk, so now, let's take for granted that we can solve the transition point problem. How does this help us solve other binary search problems?\n\nThe idea is to come up with a (problem-specific) _predicate_, like `< target`, `>= target`, or `x % 2 == 0`, which splits the search range into two regions, the \"before\" region and the \"after\" region.\n\nThis predicate is a function that takes an element of the search range and returns a boolean, and -- as you probably saw coming -- it is key that all the elements with `true` values come before the elements with `false` values (or the other way around).\n\nThen, we can use the solution to the transition point problem to find the transition point between the 'before' and 'after' regions. The only difference is that, instead of checking boolean values directly, we check the result of the predicate.\n\nYou can even wrap the predicate in a function, which we called `is_before(x)` in the book, which tells you whether a given element is in the 'before' region. Then, it's really obvious that we are just solving the transition point problem every time.\n\nThe only part that requires some thinking is choosing the right transition point. For example:\n\n*   if we want to find the _first_ occurrence of `target` in a sorted array, we can use `is_before(x) = x < target`, which means that, if `target` is present, the first occurrence is the first element in the 'after' region (so, we can check/return the `right` pointer at the end).\n*   if we want to find the _last_ occurrence of `target` in a sorted array, we can use `is_before(x) = x <= target`, which means that, if `target` is present, the last occurrence is the last element in the 'before' region (so, we can check/return the `left` pointer at the end).\n\nAnd so on for other problems.\n\n![Binary search recipe](/blog/binary-search/meme.png)\n\n## Practice\n\nYou can try the transition-point recipe on all the problems from the binary search chapter of the book online at [start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-vii-catalog/binary-search](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-vii-catalog/binary-search), even if you don't have the book. There, you can also find all our solutions using the recipe, in Python, JS, Java, and C++.\n\nBy the way, the binary search chapter of the book is free -- it's in [bctci.co/free-chapters](https://bctci.co/free-chapters).\n\n_Want to leave a comment?

      "title": "Reachability Problems and DFS",
      "content": "An extensive list of questions that can be solved with DFS.\n\n# Reachability Problems and DFS\n\nJune 21, 2020\n\n![Reachability Problems and DFS](/blog/reachability-problems-and-dfs/cover.png)\n\n## Introduction\n\nDepth-first search, or DFS, is a fundamental graph algorithm that can be used to solve **reachability** problems. This post shows how to adapt the basic DFS template to solve several problems of this kind. Reachability problems are often easier in undirected graphs. Below, we specify if the algorithm works for undirected graphs, directed graphs, or both.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nWe assume that the reader is already familiar with the concept of DFS. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fujbpJ0LB4) is an excellent video introducing DFS with step-by-step animations. We also assume that the reader is familiar with the adjacency list representation of a graph, and we use big-O notation in the analysis.\n\n### Coding conventions\n\nThe algorithms below are in Python. `n` denotes the number of nodes. Nodes are identified with integers in the range `0..n-1`. The graph `G` is a graph stored as an adjacency list: `G` is a list of `n` lists. For each `v` between `0` and `n-1`, `G[v]` is the list of neighbors of `G`.\n\nIf the graph is given as an edge list instead, we can initialize it as follows:\n\n```python\ndef makeAdjList(edgeList):\n    n = max(max(edge) for edge in edgeList) + 1\n    G = [[] for v in range(n)]\n    for u,v in edgeList:\n        G[u].append(v)\n        G[v].append(u) #omit this for directed graphs\n    return G\n\n```\n\nIf the graph is given as an adjacency matrix, we can iterate through the rows of the adjacency matrix instead of through the adjacency lists. To iterate through the neighbors of a node `v`, instead of\n\n```python\n    for u in G[v]:\n        #u is a neighbor of v\n        ...\n\n```\n\nwe do\n\n```python\n    for u in range(n):\n        if adjMatrix[v][u]:\n            #u is a neighbor of v\n            ...\n\n```\n\nNote that using an adjacency matrix affects the runtime analysis of DFS: `O(n²)` instead of `O(m)`.\n\n## Which nodes can be reached from node s?\n\nThis is the simplest question that can be answered with DFS. The primary data structure in DFS is a list of booleans to keep track of already visited nodes (we call it `vis`). If we start a DFS search from a node `s`, the reachable nodes will be the ones for which `vis` is true.\n\nFor this, `G` can be directed or undirected. We make use of a nested function in Python so that we do not need to pass `G` and `vis` as parameters (in Python nested functions have visibility over the variables in the scope where they are defined).\n\n```python\ndef reachableNodes(G, s): #G is directed or undirected\n    n = len(G)\n    vis = n * [False]\n    vis[s] = True\n\n    #invariant: v is marked as visited when calling visit(v)\n    def visit(v):\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            if not vis[nbr]:\n                vis[nbr] = True\n                visit(nbr)\n\n    visit(s)\n    return [v for v in range(n) if vis[v]]\n\n```\n\nDFS runs in `O(m)` time and `O(n)` space, where `m` is the number of edges. This is because each edge is considered twice, once from each endpoint, if the endpoints end up being visited, or zero times if the endpoints are not visited.\n\n### Iterative version\n\n```python\ndef reachableNodes(G, s): #G is directed or undirected\n    n = len(G)\n    vis = n * [False]\n    stk = [s]\n    #mark nodes as visited when removed from the stack, not when added\n    while stk:\n        v = stk.pop()\n        if vis[v]: continue\n        vis[v] = True\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            if not vis[nbr]:\n                stk.append(nbr)\n    return [v for v in range(n) if vis[v]]\n\n```\n\nThe iterative version takes `O(m)` space instead of `O(n)` because nodes can be inserted into the stack multiple times (up to one time for each incident edge). Alternatively, we can mark the nodes as visited when we add them to the stack instead of when we remove them. This change reduces the space usage to the usual `O(n)`. However, with this change, the algorithm is no longer DFS. It still works for answering reachability questions because the set visited nodes is the same, but the order in which they are visited is no longer consistent with a depth-first search order (it is closer to a BFS (breath-first search) order, but also not exactly a BFS order).\n\nThe difference between marking nodes when they added vs removed from the stack is discussed in detail [here](https://11011110.github.io/blog/2013/12/17/stack-based-graph-traversal.html). Since the recursive version is shorter and optimal in terms of space, we favor it from now on. That said, it should be easy to adapt the iterative version above to the problems below.\n\n## Can node s reach node t?\n\nWe use the same code from before, but we add early termination as soon as we see `t`. Now, the recursive function has a return value.\n\n```python\ndef canReachNode(G, s, t): #G is directed or undirected\n    n = len(G)\n    vis = n * [False]\n    vis[s] = True\n\n    #returns True if the search reaches t\n    def visit(v):\n        if v == t: return True\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            if not vis[nbr]:\n                vis[nbr] = True\n                if visit(nbr): return True\n        return False\n\n    return visit(s)\n\n```\n\nAdding the early termination can make the DFS faster, but in the worst-case the time/space complexity is the same.\n\n### Practice problems\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/)\n\nThe hardest part on this problem is constructing the graph in the first place.\n\n## Find a path from s to t\n\nThe edges \"traversed\" in a DFS search form a tree called the \"DFS tree\". The DFS tree changes depending on where we start the search. The starting node is called the root. We can construct the DFS tree by keeping track of the predecessor of each node in the search (the root has no predecessor). If we construct the DFS tree rooted at `s`, we can follow the sequence of predecessors from `t` to `s` to find a path from `s` to `t` in reverse order.\n\nInstead of using the list `vis` to keep track of visited nodes, we know a node is unvisited if it has no predecessor yet. We indicate that a node has no predecessor with the special value `-1`.\n\n```python\ndef findPath(G, s, t): #G is directed or undirected\n    n = len(G)\n    pred = n * [-1]\n    pred[s] = None\n    def visit(v):\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            if pred[nbr] == -1:\n                pred[nbr] = v\n                visit(nbr)\n    visit(s) #builds DFS tree\n    path = [t]\n    while path[-1] != s:\n        p = pred[path[-1]]\n        if p == -1: return None #cannot reach t from s\n        path.append(p)\n    path.reverse()\n    return path\n\n```\n\nNote that DFS does _not_ find the shortest path form `s` to `t`. For that, we can use BFS (breath-first search). It just returns any path without repeated nodes.\n\n## Is the graph connected?\n\nFor undirected graphs, this is almost the same question as the first question (\"which nodes can be reached by `s`?\") because of the following property:\n\n_An undirected graph is connected if and only if every node can be reached from `s`, where `s` is any of the nodes._\n\nThus, the code is exactly the same as for the first question, with two differences: 1) we choose `s` to be `0` (could be anything), and 2) we change the last line to check if every entry in `vis` is true.\n\n```python\ndef isConnected(G): #G is undirected\n    n = len(G)\n    vis = n * [False]\n    vis[0] = True\n    def visit(v):\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            if not vis[nbr]:\n                vis[nbr] = True\n                visit(nbr)\n    visit(0)\n    return all(vis)\n\n```\n\nFor directed graphs, we need to take into account the direction of the edges. A directed graph is **strongly connected** if every node can reach every other node. We can use the following property:\n\n_A directed graph is strongly connected if and only if `s` can reach every node and every node can reach `s`, where `s` is any of the nodes._\n\nWe already know how to use DFS to check if `s` can reach every node. To check if every node can reach `s`, we can do a DFS starting from `s`, **but in the reverse graph of G**. The reverse graph of `G` is like `G` but reversing the directions of all the edges.\n\n```python\ndef isConnected(G): #G is directed\n    n = len(G)\n    vis = n * [False]\n    vis[0] = True #use 0 for start node\n    def visit(G, v):\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            if not vis[nbr]:\n                vis[nbr] = True\n                visit(G, nbr)\n    visit(G, 0) #nodes reachable from s\n    if not all(vis): return False\n    Greverse = [[] for v in range(n)]\n    for v in range(n):\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            Greverse[nbr].append(v)\n    vis = n * [False] #reset vis for the second search\n    vis[0] = True\n    visit(Greverse, 0) #nodes that can reach s\n    return all(vis)\n\n```\n\nThe runtime is still `O(m)`, but the space is now `O(m)` because we need to create and store the reverse graph. There are alternative algorithms (like Tarjan's algorithm) which can do this in `O(n)` space.\n\n## How many connected components are there?\n\nWe can use the typical DFS to answer this question for undirected graphs. We use a common pattern in DFS algorithms: an outer loop through all the nodes where we launch a search for every yet-unvisited node.\n\n```python\ndef numConnectedComponents(G): #G is undirected\n    n = len(G)\n    vis = n * [False]\n    def visit(v):\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            if not vis[nbr]:\n                vis[nbr] = True\n                visit(nbr)\n    numCCs = 0\n    for v in range(n):\n        if not vis[v]:\n            numCCs += 1\n            vis[v] = True\n            visit(v)\n    return numCCs\n\n```\n\nThe runtime is now `O(n+m)` because, if `m < n`, we still spend `O(n)` time iterating through the loop at the end.\n\nFor directed graphs, instead of connected components, we talk about **strongly connected components**. A strongly connected component is a maximal subset of nodes where every node can reach every other node.\n\nIf we want to find the number of strongly connected components, we can use something like [Tarjan's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm), a DFS-based algorithm that requires some additional data structures.\n\n### Practice problems\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/) (Premium only)\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/)\n\n## Which nodes are in the same connected components?\n\nThis question is more general than the previous two. We label each node `v` with a number `CC[v]` so that nodes with the same number belong to the same CC. Instead of having a list `CC` in addition to `vis`, we use the CC number `-1` to indicate unvisited nodes. This way, we do not need `vis`\n\n```python\ndef connectedComponents(G): #G is undirected\n    n = len(G)\n    CC = n * [-1]\n\n    ##invariant: v is labeled with CC i>=0\n    def visit(v, i):\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            if CC[nbr] == -1:\n                CC[nbr] = i\n                visit(nbr, i)\n\n    i = 0\n    for v in range(n):\n        if CC[v] == -1:\n            CC[v] = i\n            visit(v, i)\n            i += 1\n    return CC\n\n```\n\nFor directed graphs, again we need Tarjan's algorithm or an equivalent algorithm.\n\n### Practice problems\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-ii/](https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-ii/)\n\nIn the second problem, nodes are given by names, not indices, so they need to be converted.\n\n## Is the graph acyclic?\n\nFor undirected graphs, this question is simple. First, we consider the problem in each CC independently. This is very common pattern in graph problems. We do this with an outer loop through all the nodes where we launch a search for every yet-unvisited node.\n\nDuring the DFS search in each CC, if we find an edge to an already visited node that is not the predecessor in the search (the node we just came from), there is a cycle. Such edges in a DFS search are called **back edges**. We add one parameter to the recursive function `visit` to know the predecessor node.\n\n```python\ndef hasCycles(G): #G is undirected\n    n = len(G)\n    vis = n * [False]\n\n    #returns True if the search finds a back edge\n    def visit(v, p):\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            if vis[nbr] and nbr != p: return True\n            if not vis[nbr]:\n                vis[nbr] = True\n                if visit(nbr, v): return True\n        return False\n\n    for v in range(n):\n        if not vis[v]:\n            vis[v] = True\n            #the root of the search has no predecessor\n            if visit(v, -1): return True\n    return False\n\n```\n\nFor directed graphs, it is not as simple: the fact that a neighbor `nbr` is already visited during the DFS search does not mean that `nbr` can reach the current node. To check if a directed graph is acyclic, we can use the linear-time [peel-off algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn's_algorithm) for finding a topological ordering. This algorithm detects if the graph is acyclic and finds a topological ordering if so, though we are only interested in the first part.\n\n### Practice problems\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/)\n\nThis problem is easier to solve using union-find, but it can be done with DFS.\n\n## Is the graph a tree?\n\nUsually, we ask this question for undirected graphs. We can use this characterization of trees:\n\n_An undirected graph is a tree if and only if it is connected and has exactly `n-1` edges._\n\nWe already saw how to check if the graph is connected with DFS, and counting the number of edges is straightforward:\n\n```python\n    #for undirected graphs:\n    m = sum(len(G[v]) for v in range(n)) / 2\n    #for directed graphs:\n    m = sum(len(G[v]) for v in range(n))\n\n```\n\n### Practice problems\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/)\n\n## Is the graph bipartite?\n\nThis is exactly the same question as whether the graph can be two-colored, so see the next section.\n\n## Can the graph be two-colored?\n\nTwo-coloring a graph means assigning colors to the nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, using only two colors. Usually, we consider coloring question for undirected graphs.\n\nWe consider whether each CC can be colored independently from the others. We can color each CC using DFS. We use values `0` and `1` for the colors. The color of the start node can be anything, so we set it to `0`. For the remaining nodes, the color has to be different from the parent, so we only have one option.\n\nInstead of having a `vis` array, we use the special color `-1` to denote unvisited nodes.\n\n```python\ndef is2Colorable(G): #G is undirected\n    n = len(G)\n    color = n * [-1]\n\n    #returns True if we can color all the nodes reached from v\n    #invariant: v has an assigned color\n    def visit(v):\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            if color[nbr] == color[v]: return False\n            if color[nbr] == -1:\n                color[nbr] = 1 if color[v] == 0 else 0\n                if not visit(nbr): return False\n        return True\n\n    for v in range(n):\n        if color[v] == -1:\n            color[v] = 0\n            if not visit(v): return False\n    return True\n\n```\n\nWith 3 or more colors, the problem becomes [a lot harder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring#Algorithms).\n\n### Practice problems\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/)\n\n## What is the distance from a node s to every other node in a tree?\n\nWe cannot use DFS to find the distance between nodes in a graph which can have cycles, because DFS is not guaranteed to follow the shortest path from the root to the other nodes. For that, BFS is more suitable (if the graph is unweighted). However, since trees are acyclic, there is a unique path between any two nodes, so DFS must use the unique path, which, by necessity, is the shortest path. Thus, we can use DFS to find distances in a tree.\n\n```python\ndef getDistances(G, s): #G is undirected and a tree\n    n = len(G)\n    dists = n * [-1]\n    dists[s] = 0\n\n    #invariant: v has an assigned distance\n    def visit(v):\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            #check nbr is not the predecessor\n            if dists[nbr] != -1: continue\n            dists[nbr] = dists[v] + 1\n            visit(nbr)\n    visit(s)\n    return dists\n\n```\n\n### Practice problems\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-inform-all-employees/](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-inform-all-employees/)\n\n## Find a spanning tree\n\nA spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph `G` is a subgraph which has the same nodes as `G` that is a tree. The edges traversed by a DFS search on a connected graph form a spanning tree (sometimes called a DFS tree). Thus, we do DFS and add the traversed edges to the resulting tree.\n\n```python\ndef spanningTree(G): #G is undirected and connected\n    n = len(G)\n    vis = n * [False]\n    vis[0] = True\n    T = [[] for v in range(n)]\n\n    def visit(v):\n        for nbr in G[v]:\n            if not vis[nbr]:\n                vis[nbr] = True\n                T[v].append(nbr)\n                T[nbr].append(v)\n                visit(nbr)\n    visit(0)\n    return T\n\n```\n\n## Conclusions\n\nDFS has many uses. We showed how to make minor modifications to the DFS template to answer reachability and connectivity questions.\n\nAfter DFS, the next algorithm to learn would be BFS (breath-first search). Like DFS, it can answer reachability questions. On top of that, it can also answer questions about distance in undirected graphs.",

To simplify/demystify it, I tried to break it down into a logical sequence of steps, each of which should not feel too intimidating on its own. This is explained in detail here. To complement the explanations, there are links to problems on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/), in case the reader wants to practice. The code snippets are in Python, but Leetcode accepts most popular languages.\n\n## Overview: Recursive vs Iterative DP\n\nIn short, dynamic programming (DP) is a technique for problems that seem hard to solve as a whole, but become easy if we know the solution to smaller subproblems. More technically, we can use it in problems where the (value of the) solution can be expressed as an equation which is a function of the input, and is expressed in terms of itself with smaller inputs. This is called a _recurrence equation_. The classic example is the Fibonacci recurrence: `Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)`.\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)\n\nA recurrence equation can be translated into code:\n\n```python\ndef Fib(n):\n  if n == 0 or n == 1:\n    return 1\n  return Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)\n\n```\n\nHowever, the above function has an exponential runtime. A recursive function becomes exponential when it is possible to reach the same subcall through different execution paths. In the Fibonacci case, we have the following nested calls: `Fib(n) -> Fib(n-1) -> Fib(n-2)`, and `Fib(n) -> Fib(n-2)`. Since `Fib(n-2)` is called twice all the work from this call is duplicated, which in turn means that subcalls made from `Fib(n-2)` will start to duplicate and grow exponentially.\n\nDynamic programming is simply a workaround to this duplication issue. Instead of recomputing the solutions of the subproblems, we store them and then we recall them as needed. This guarantees that each subproblem is computed only once.\n\nThere are two main approaches for DP.\n\n### Recursive / Top-down DP\n\nWe start with the code which is a literal translation of the recurrence equation, but then we add a dictionary / hash table to store results.\n\n```python\nmemo = {}\n\ndef Fib(n):\n  if n == 0 or n == 1:\n    return 1\n  if n in memo:\n    return memo[n]\n  res = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)\n  memo[n] = res\n  return res\n\n```\n\nThere are three changes in the code above:\n\n1.  declaring our dictionary for storing results, `memo` outside the recursive function (memo comes \"memorization\" or \"memoization\", a name used in the literature).\n2.  before computing the result, we check if the solution has already been computed. This check can be done before or after the base case.\n3.  before returning, we save the result in the `memo` table.\n\nUsing a memoization table in this way solves the inefficiency (we will go deeper into the analysis part later).\n\n### Iterative / Bottom-up DP\n\nInstead of starting from the largest input and recursively reaching smaller subproblems, we can directly compute the subproblems from smallest to largest. This way, we already have the solutions to the subproblems when we need them. For this approach, we change the dictionary for an array/vector, and we change recursive calls for a for loop.\n\n```python\ndef Fib(n):\n  if n == 0: return 1\n  memo = [0 for i in range(n+1)]\n  memo[0], memo[1] = 1, 1\n  for i in range(2, n+1):\n    memo[i] = memo[i-1] + memo[i-2]\n  return memo[n]\n\n```\n\nMost problems can be solved with both recursive and iterative DP. Here are some considerations for how to choose:\n\n*   Recursive DP matches the recurrence equation more directly, so it can be easier to implement.\n*   Both have the same runtime complexity, but the recursive version will generally have larger constant factors due to all the recursive function calling and due to using a hash table instead of an array.\n*   Iterative DP often allows for an optimization to reduce the space complexity (discussed later).\n\n## Recursive DP in 5 Steps\n\n1.  Choose what your subproblems are.\n2.  Find the recurrence equation.\n3.  Translate the recurrence equation into recursive code.\n4.  Add memoization.\n5.  (Optional) Reconstruct the solution.\n\nWe already saw steps 1–4 with the Fibonacci example. Now, we will walk through all the steps in more detail using a more complicated example, the _longest common subsequence problem_:\n\nGiven two strings `s1` and `s2`, find the length of the longest string which is a subsequence of both `s1` and `s2`. A string `t` is a _subsequence_ of a string `s` if every char in `t` appears **in order** in `s`, but are **not necessarily contiguous**. For example, `abc` is a subsequence of `axbyz`, but `ba` is not (do not confuse subsequence with substring or subset).\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)\n\nStep 1: choose our subproblems. This varies from problem to problem, but when the input to the problem is a string, a natural way to obtain smaller problems is to look at shorter strings. Here we can use as a subproblem a _prefix_ of `s1` and a prefix of `s2`.\n\nSome notation: let `n` be the length of `s1` and `m` the length of `s2`. Let `LCS(i,j)` be the solution for the LCS problem for the prefix of `s1` of length `n` (`s1[0..i-1]`) and the prefix of `s2` of length `m` (`s2[0..j-1]`). Then, our goal is to find `LCS(n, m)`.\n\nStep 2: find the recurrence equation. Now we need to come up with an expression for `LCS(i,j)` as a function of `LCS` with smaller indices (as well as a base case). This is the hardest step of DP, and often it is here that we realize that we chose bad subproblems in Step 1. If that happens, hopefully we will discover some hint for what our subproblems should be.\n\nIn order to derive the recurrence equation for LCS, we need the following observation: if the two strings end with the same character `c`, then, to maximize the length of the subsequence, it is \"safe\" to add `c` to the subsequence. In contrast, if both strings end with different characters, then _at least_ one of them cannot appear in the subsequence. The complication is that we do not know which one. Thus, instead of guessing, we can simply consider both options.\n\nThis observation yields the recurrence equation (excluding base case):\n\n```python\nLCS(i, j) = 1 + LCS(i-1, j-1)                 if s[i] == s[j]\n            max(LCS(i, j-1), LCS(i-1, j))     otherwise\n\n```\n\nThis step is not intuitive at first, and requires practice. After having done a few problems, one starts to recognize the typical patterns in DP. For instance, using `max` among a set of options of which we do not know which one is the best is easily the most common pattern in DP.\n\nStep 3. Translate the recurrence equation into recursive code. This step is a very simple programming task. Pay attention to the base case.\n\n```python\n#outer call:\nLCS(len(s1), len(s2))\n\ndef LCS(i, j):\n  if i == 0 or j == 0:\n    return 0\n  if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:\n    return 1 + LCS(i-1, j-1)\n  else:\n    return max(LCS(i, j-1), LCS(i-1, j))\n\n```\n\nIf we draw the few first steps of the call graph, we will see that the same subproblem is reached twice. Thus, call graph blows up, leading to an exponential runtime.\n\nStep 4. Add memo table. This step should be automatic: one does not even need to understand the previous code in order to add the memo table.\n\n```python\n#outer call:\nmemo = {}\nLCS(len(s1), len(s2))\n\ndef LCS(i, j):\n  if i == 0 or j == 0:\n    return 0\n  if (i,j) in memo:\n    return memo[(i,j)]\n  if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:\n    res = 1 + LCS(i-1, j-1)\n  else:\n    res = max(LCS(i, j-1), LCS(i-1, j))\n  memo[(i,j)] = res\n  return res\n\n```\n\nThe base case corresponds to when one of the strings is empty. The LCS of an empty string with another string is clearly an empty string.\n\nIncidentally, if we flip the check on the memo table, the code becomes a bit more streamlined (fewer lines + merging the two returns). I prefer this form (it does the same):\n\n```python\ndef LCS(i, j):\n  if i == 0 or j == 0:\n    return 0\n  if (i,j) not in memo:\n    if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:\n      memo[(i,j)] = 1 + LCS(i-1, j-1)\n    else:\n      memo[(i,j)] = max(LCS(i, j-1), LCS(i-1, j))\n  return memo[(i,j)]\n\n```\n\nWe have eliminated the exponential blowup. In general, DP algorithms can be analyzed as follows: # of distinct subproblems times time per subproblem excluding recursive calls. For LCS, we get `O(nm)*O(1)=O(nm)`.\n\nStep 5. Reconstruct the solution.\n\nWe used DP to compute the length of the LCS. What if we want to find the LCS itself? A naive way to do it would be to store the entire result of each subproblem in the memoization table instead of just its length. While this works, it is clear that it will require a lot of memory to store `O(nm)` strings of length `O(min(n,m))` each. We can do better.\n\nStep 5, \"Reconstruct the solution\", is how to reuse the table that we constructed in Step 4 to find the actual solution instead of just its length. I said that this step is optional because sometimes we just need the _value_ of the solution, so there is no reconstruction needed.\n\nThe good news is that we do not need to modify the code that we already wrote in Step 4. The reconstruction is a separate step that comes after. In addition, the reconstruction step is very similar (follows the same set of cases) as the step of building the memo table. In short, we use the memo table as an \"oracle\" to guide us in our choices. Based on the values in the memo table, we know which option is better, so we know how to reconstruct the solution.\n\n```python\n#outer calls\nmemo = {}\nn, m = len(s1), len(s2)\nLCS(n, m) #build memo table\nsol = reconstructLCS(n, m)\n\ndef reconstructLCS(i, j):\n  if i == 0 or j == 0:\n    return \"\"\n  if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:\n    return reconstructLCS(i-1, j-1) + s1[i-1]\n  elif memo[(i-1,j)] >= memo[(i,j-1)]:\n    return reconstructLCS(i-1, j)\n  else:\n    return reconstructLCS(i, j-1)\n\n```\n\nIn the code above, first we run `LCS(n,m)` to fill the memo table. Then, we use it in the reconstruction. The condition `memo[(i-1,j)] >= memo[(i,j-1)]` tells us that we can obtain a longer or equal LCS by discarding a char from `s1` instead of from `s2`.\n\nNote that there is a single recursive call in the reconstruction function, so the complexity is just `O(n+m)`.\n\n## Iterative DP in 6 Steps\n\n1.  Choose what your subproblems are.\n2.  Find the recurrence equation.\n3.  **Design the memo table.**\n4.  **Fill the memo table.**\n5.  (Optional) Reconstruct the solution.\n6.  **(Optional) Space optimization.**\n\nThe new/different steps are highlighted. Step 3. is to design the layout of the table/matrix where we are going to store the subproblem solutions. There is no coding in this step. By \"design\", I mean making the following choices:\n\n*   what are the dimensions of the table, and what does each index mean. Generally speaking, the table should have one dimension for each parameter of the recurrence equation. In the case of LCS, it will be a 2-dimensional table.\n*   where are the base cases.\n*   where is the cell with the final solution.\n*   what is the \\`\\`dependence relationship'' between cells (which cells do you need in order to compute each cell).\n*   which cells do not need to be filled (in the case of LCS, we need them all).\n\nHere is how I would lay out the table for LCS (you can find a different layout in the problems below):\n\n![LCS table](/blog/breaking-down-dynamic-programming/lcstable.svg)\n\nNext (Step 4), we fill the memo table with a nested for loop. If the layout is good, this should be easy. Before the main loop, we fill the base case entries. Then, we must make sure to iterate through the table in an order that respects the dependencies between cells. In the case of LCS, we can iterate both by rows or by columns.\n\nWe obtain the following algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef LCS(s1, s2):\n  n, m = len(s1), len(s2)\n  memo = [[0 for j in range(m+1)] for i in range(n+1)]\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n    for j in range(1, m+1):\n      if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:\n        memo[i][j] = 1 + memo[i-1][j-1]\n      else:\n        memo[i][j] = max(memo[i-1][j], memo[i][j-1])\n  return memo[n][m]\n\n```\n\nIn the code above, the base case entries are filled implicitly when we initialize the table with zeros everywhere.\n\nIf we need to reconstruct the solution, we can do it in the same way as for the recursive DP. The only difference is that memo is a matrix instead of dictionary.\n\n### Space optimization\n\nClearly, the space complexity of iterative DP is the size of the DP table. Often, we can do better. The idea is to only store the already-computed table entries that we will use to compute future entries. For instance, in the case of Fibonacci, we do not need to create an entire array -- keeping the last two numbers suffice. In the case of a 2-dimensional DP table, if we are filling the DP table by rows and each cell only depends on the previous row, we only need to keep the last row (and similarly if we iterated by columns). Here is the final version for LCS where we improve the space complexity from `O(nm)` to `O(n+m)`:\n\n```python\ndef LCS(s1, s2):\n  n, m = len(s1), len(s2)\n  lastRow = [0 for j in range(m+1)]\n  for i in range(1,n+1):\n    curRow = [0 for j in range(m+1)]\n    for j in range(1,m+1):\n      if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:\n        curRow[j] = 1 + lastRow[j-1]\n      else:\n        curRow[j] = max(lastRow[j], curRow[j-1])\n    lastRow = curRow\n  return lastRow[m]\n\n```\n\nNote: this optimization is incompatible with reconstructing the solution, because that uses the entire table as an \"oracle\".\n\n## DP Patterns\n\nHere are some typical patterns:\n\n### For Step 1. The subproblems.\n\n*   If the input is a string or a list, the subproblems are usually prefixes or substrings/sublists, which can be specified as a pair of indices.\n*   If the input is a number, the subproblems are usually smaller numbers.\n*   Generally speaking, the number of subproblems will be linear or quadratic on the input size.\n\n### For Step 2. The recurrence equation.\n\n*   Often, we use `max` or `min` to choose between options, or sum to aggregate subsolutions.\n*   The number of subproblems is most often constant, but sometimes it is linear on the subproblem size. In the latter case, we use an inner loop to aggregate/choose the best solution.\n*   Sometimes, the recurrence equation is not exactly for the original problem, but for a related but more constrained problem. See an example below, \"Longest Increasing Subsequence\".\n\n## Practice Problems\n\nHere are some practice problems showcasing the patterns mentioned above. Follow the Leetcode links for the statements and example inputs. I jump directly to the solutions. I'd recommend trying to solve the problems before checking them.\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)\n\nHere, the goal is to count the number of substrings of a string `s` which are palindromic. There is a trivial `O(n³)` time solution without DP:\n\n```python\ndef countSubstrings(s):\n  n = len(s)\n  count = 0\n  for i in range(n):\n      for j in range(i, n):\n          if isPalindrome(s[i:j+1]):\n              count += 1\n  return count\n\n```\n\nWe can improve this to `O(n²)` with DP. The subproblems are all the substrings of `s`. Let `Pal(i, j)` be true iff `s[i..j]` is a palindrome. We have the following recurrence equation (excluding base cases):\n\n```python\nPal(i, j) = false           if s[i] != s[j],\nPAl(i, j) = Pal(i+1, j-1)   otherwise\n\n```\n\nBased on this recurrence equation, we can design the following DP table:\n\n![Table for substring count](/blog/breaking-down-dynamic-programming/palindrometable.svg)\n\nThis type of \"diagonal\" DP tables are very common when the subproblems are substrings/sublists. In this case, the base cases are substrings of length 1 or 2. The goal is `Pal(0,n-1)`.\n\nGiven the dependency, the table can be filled by rows (starting from the last row), by columns (starting each column from the bottom), or by diagonals (i.e., from shortest to longest substrings). In the code below, I illustrate how to fill the table by diagonals.\n\n```python\ndef countSubstrings(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    T = [[False for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        T[i][i] = True\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        T[i][i+1] = s[i] == s[i+1]\n\n    for size in range(2, n+1):\n        for i in range(0,n-size):\n            j = i + size\n            T[i][j] = s[i] == s[j] and T[i+1][j-1]\n\n    count = 0\n    for row in T:\n        for val in row:\n            if val:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\n```\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)\n\nHere, a subproblem can be a grid with reduced width and height. Let `T[i][j]` be the cheapest cost to reach cell `(i,j)`. The goal is to find `T[n-1][m-1]`, where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid. The base case is when either `i` or `j` are zero, in which case we do not have any choices for how to get there. In the general case, we have the recurrence equation `T[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(T[i-1][j], T[i][j-1])`: to get to `(i,j)`, we first need to get to either `(i-1,j)` or to `(i,j-1)`. We use `min` to choose the best of the two. We convert this into an iterative solution:\n\n```python\ndef minPathSum(grid):\n    n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    T = [[0 for j in range(m)] for i in range(n)]\n\n    T[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        T[i][0] = grid[i][0] + T[i-1][0]\n    for j in range(1, m):\n        T[0][j] = grid[0][j] + T[0][j-1]\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(1, m):\n            T[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(T[i-1][j], T[i][j-1])\n\n    return T[n-1][m-1]\n\n```\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)\n\nThis is similar to the previous problem, but we need to accumulate the solutions to the subproblems, instead of choosing between them. Problems about _counting_ solutions can often be solved with DP.\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)\n\nThis problem will illustrate a new trick: if you cannot find a recurrence equation for the original problem, try to find one for a more restricted version of the problem which nevertheless you enough information to compute the original problem.\n\nHere, the input is a list `L` of numbers, and we need to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (a subsequence does not need to be contiguous). Again, the subproblems correspond to prefixes of the list. Let `LIS(i)` be the solution for the prefix of length `i` (`L[0..i]`). The goal is to find `LIS(n-1)`, where `n` is the length of `L`. However, it is not easy to give a recurrence equation for `LIS(i)` as a function of smaller prefixes. In particular, **the following is wrong** (I will let the reader think why):\n\n```python\nLIS(i) = LIS(i-1) + 1   if L[i] > L[i-1],\nLIS(i) = LIS(i-1)       otherwise\n\n```\n\nThus, we actually give a recurrence equation for a slightly modified type of subproblems: let `LIS2(i)` be the length of the LIS **ending at index i**. This constraint makes it easier to give a recurrence equation:\n\n```python\nLIS2(i) = 1 + max(LIS2(j)) over all j < i such that L[j] < L[i]\n\n```\n\nIn short, since we know that the LIS ends at `L[i]`, we consider all candidate predecessors, which are the numbers smaller than it, and get the best one by using `max`. Crucially, this recurrence works for `LIS2(i)` but not for `LIS(i)`. Here is a full solution:\n\n```python\ndef LIS(L):\n  n = len(L)\n  T = [0 for i in range(n)]\n  T[0] = 1\n  for i in range(1, n):\n      T[i] = 1\n      for j in range(0, i):\n          if L[j] < L[i]:\n              T[i] = max(T[i], T[j] + 1)\n  return max(T)\n\n```\n\nAt the end, we do not simply return `T[n-1]` because `T` is the table for `LCS2`, not `LCS`. We return `max(T)` because the LCS must end _somewhere_, so `LCS(n-1) = LCS2(j)` for some `j < n`.\n\nNote that the runtime is `O(n²)` even though the table has linear size. This is because we take linear time per subproblem.\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/)\n\nA harder version of the previous problem.

In this article, I share an approach for implementing tree traversal algorithms iteratively that I found to be simple to remember and implement, while being flexible enough to do anything that a recursive algorithm can (I also didn't like most suggestions I saw online). The main technique is given in section [\"Iterative Postorder and Inorder Traversal\"](#iterative-postorder-and-inorder-traversal), but first I give some context. I also link to practice problems on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com) for the reader to play with. I provide some solutions, but I suggest trying the problems out first. The code snippets are in C++, but leetcode accepts most languages.\n\n## What are Tree Traversals\n\nMathematically, trees are just connected acyclic graphs. However, in the context of tree traversals, we are usually working with **rooted trees** represented with a recursive structure such as the following (which is the default definition in Leetcode for binary trees). A leaf is a node with two null pointers as children:\n\n```cpp\nstruct TreeNode {\n  int val;\n  TreeNode *left;\n  TreeNode *right;\n  TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}\n};\n\n```\n\nA tree traversal is an algorithm that visits every node in a tree in a specific order (and does some computation with them, depending on the problem). For binary trees specifically, there are three important orders:\n\n*   **Preorder:** root before children. As we will see, this is the simplest to implement.\n*   **Inorder:** left child, then root, then right child. This traversal is most often used on _binary search trees_ (BST). A BST is a rooted binary tree with the additional property that every node in the left subtree has a smaller value than the root, and every node in the right subtree has a larger value than the root. This traversal is called \"inorder\" because, when used on a BST, it will visit the nodes from smallest to largest.\n*   **Postorder:** children before root. It comes up in problems where we have to aggregate information about the entire subtree rooted at each node. Classic examples are computing the size, the height, or the sum of values of the tree.\n\n![Tree traversals](/blog/iterative-tree-traversals/traversals.svg)\n\nBecause rooted trees are recursive data structures, algorithms on trees are most naturally expressed recursively. Here are the three traversals. I use the function `process(node)` as a placeholder for whatever computation the problem calls for.\n\n```cpp\nvoid preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\n  if (!root) return;\n  process(root);\n  preorderTraversal(root->left);\n  preorderTraversal(root->right);\n}\n\nvoid inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\n  if (!root) return;\n  inorderTraversal(root->left);\n  process(root);\n  inorderTraversal(root->right);\n}\n\nvoid postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\n  if (!root) return;\n  postorderTraversal(root->left);\n  postorderTraversal(root->right);\n  process(root);\n}\n\n```\n\nSide-note: in C++, pointers are implicitly converted to booleans: a pointer evaluates to true if and only if it is not null. So, in the code above, \"`if (!root)`\" is equivalent to \"`if (root == NULL)`\".\n\n### Traversal problems on leetcode\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)\n\n## Why / When to Use an Iterative Traversal\n\nIf the recursive implementation is so simple, why bother with an iterative one? Of course, to avoid stack overflow. Most runtime engines/compilers set a limit on how many nested calls a program can make. For example, according to [this article](https://freecontent.manning.com/stack-safe-recursion-in-java/):\n\n> _Default stack size varies between 320k and 1024k depending on the version of Java and the system used. For a 64 bits Java 8 program with minimal stack usage, the maximum number of nested method calls is about 7000._\n\nIf the height of the tree is larger than this limit, the program will crash with a **stack overflow error**. A recursive implementation is safe to use if:\n\n*   Somehow we know that the input trees will be small enough.\n*   The tree is _balanced_, which means that, for each node, the left and right subtrees have roughly the same height. In a balanced tree, the height is guaranteed to be _logarithmic_ on the number of nodes (indeed, that is why balanced BSTs guarantee _O(log n)_ search time), so any tree that fits in RAM (or even disk) will require a tiny number of recursive calls.\n\nHowever, if we are not in either of the cases above, an iterative solution is safer.\n\nRecursive and iterative traversals have the same runtime complexity, so this is not a concern when choosing either (all the problems shown in this article can be solved in linear time using either).\n\nThe main approach for converting recursive implementations to iterative ones is to \"simulate\" the call stack with an actual stack where we push and pop the nodes explicitly. This works great \"out-of-the-box\" with preorder traversal.\n\nIncidentally, when implementing tree traversals we need to make an implementation choice about how to handle NULL pointers. We can be eager and filter them out before adding them to the stack, or we can be lazy and detect them once we extract them from the stack. Both are fine—what matters is to be deliberate and consistent about which approach we are using. I prefer the latter as it yields slightly shorter code, so I will use it in all the following examples. For comparison, here is the iterative preorder traversal with both approaches:\n\n```cpp\n//eager NULL checking\nvoid preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\n  stack<TreeNode*> stk;\n  if (!root) return;\n  stk.push(root);\n  while (!stk.empty()) {\n    TreeNode* node = stk.top();\n    stk.pop();\n    process(node);\n    if (node->right) stk.push(node->right);\n    if (node->left) stk.push(node->left);\n  }\n}\n\n//lazy NULL checking\nvoid preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\n  stack<TreeNode*> stk;\n  stk.push(root);\n  while (!stk.empty()) {\n    TreeNode* node = stk.top();\n    stk.pop();\n    if (!node) continue;\n    process(node);\n    stk.push(node->right);\n    stk.push(node->left);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nNote that **the right child is pushed to the stack before the left one**. This is because we want the left child to be above in the stack so that it is processed first.\n\n### Preorder traversal practice problems\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)\n\nThis problem asks to find the depth of a binary tree (follow the link for the description and examples). It requires passing information from each node to its children. We can do this by changing the stack to `stack<pair<TreeNode*, int>>`, so that we can pass an `int` to each child, as in the solution below:\n\n```cpp\nint maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {\n    int res = 0;\n    stack<pair<TreeNode*, int>> stk;\n    stk.push({root, 1}); //node, depth\n    while (!stk.empty()) {\n        auto node = stk.top().first;\n        int depth = stk.top().second;\n        stk.pop();\n        if (!node) continue;\n        res = max(res, depth);\n        stk.push({node->left, depth+1});\n        stk.push({node->right, depth+1});\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\n```\n\nIn the code above, the `{}` notation is used to create pairs (e.g., `{root, 0}`). If one is not familiar with pairs in C++, or is using a language without the equivalent, a simple alternative is to use two separate stacks, one for the nodes and one for the info.\n\nThe next two problems are similar:\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)\n\nA solution for the last one, this time using a stack with a pair of nodes:\n\n```cpp\nbool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {\n    if (!root) return true;\n    stack<pair<TreeNode*, TreeNode*>> stk;\n    stk.push({root->left, root->right});\n    while (!stk.empty()) {\n        TreeNode* l = stk.top().first;\n        TreeNode* r = stk.top().second;\n        stk.pop();\n        if (!l and !r) continue;\n        if (!l or !r or l->val != r->val) return false;\n        stk.push({l->left, r->right});\n        stk.push({l->right, r->left});\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\n```\n\n## Iterative Postorder and Inorder Traversal\n\nWhile iterative preorder traversal is straightforward, with postorder and inorder we run into a complication: we cannot simply swap the order of the lines as with the recursive implementation. In other words, the following does _not_ yield a postorder traversal:\n\n```cpp\n...\nstk.push(node->right);\nstk.push(node->left);\nprocess(node);\n...\n\n```\n\nThe node is still processed before its children, which is not what we want.\n\n**The workaround, once again emulating the recursive implementation, is to visit each node twice.** We consider postorder traversal first. In the first visit, we only push the children onto the stack. In the second visit, we do the actual processing. The simplest way to do this is to enhance the stack with a **\"visit number flag\"**. Implementation-wise, we change the stack to `stack<pair<TreeNode*, int>>` so that we can pass the flag along with each node. The iterative postorder looks like this:\n\n```cpp\nvoid postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\n  stack<pair<TreeNode*,int>> stk; //node, visit #\n  stk.push({root, 0});\n  while (!stk.empty()) {\n    TreeNode* node = stk.top().first;\n    int visit = stk.top().second;\n    stk.pop();\n    if (!node) continue;\n    if (visit == 0) {\n      stk.push({node, 1});\n      stk.push({node->right, 0});\n      stk.push({node->left, 0});\n    } else { //visit == 1\n      process(node);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nNote the order in which the nodes are added to the stack when `visit == 0`. The parent ends up under its children, with the left child on top. Since it is the first time that the children are added to the stack, their visit-number flag is 0. For the parent, it is 1. For simplicity, I also follow the convention to always immediately call pop after extracting the top element from the stack.\n\nThe same approach also works for inorder traversal (that's the point). Here is a version where we visit each node three times: one to push the left child, one to process the node, and one to push the right child.\n\n```cpp\n//3-visit version\nvoid inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\n  stack<pair<TreeNode*,int>> stk;\n  stk.push({root, 0});\n  while (!stk.empty()) {\n    TreeNode* node = stk.top().first;\n    int visit = stk.top().second;\n    stk.pop();\n    if (!node) continue;\n    if (visit == 0) {\n      stk.push({node, 1});\n      stk.push({node->left, 0});\n    } else if (visit == 1) {\n      stk.push({node, 2});\n      process(node);\n    } else { //visit == 2\n      stk.push({node->right, 0});\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nIn fact, the second and third visits can be merged together: processing the node does not modify the stack, so the two visits are followed one after the other anyway. Here is my preferred version:\n\n```cpp\n//2-visit version\nvoid inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\n  stack<pair<TreeNode*,int>> stk;\n  stk.push({root, 0});\n  while (!stk.empty()) {\n    TreeNode* node = stk.top().first;\n    int visit = stk.top().second;\n    stk.pop();\n    if (!node) continue;\n    if (visit == 0) {\n      stk.push({node, 1});\n      stk.push({node->left, 0});\n    } else { //visit == 1\n      process(node);\n      stk.push({node->right, 0});\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nFor completeness, here is the version found in most of my top Google hits (see [this](https://www.techiedelight.com/inorder-tree-traversal-iterative-recursive/) for a nice explanation):\n\n```cpp\nvoid inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\n    stack<TreeNode*> stk;\n    TreeNode* curr = root;\n    while (curr or !stk.empty()) {\n        while (curr) {\n            stk.push(curr);\n            curr = curr->left;\n        }\n        curr = stk.top();\n        stk.pop();\n        process(curr);\n        curr = curr->right;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nWhile it is shorter, it cannot be easily converted to postorder traversal, so it is not as flexible. Also, I find it easier to follow the execution flow with the visit-number flag.\n\n### Inorder traversal practice problems\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)\n\nA solution (follow the link for the statement and examples):\n\n```cpp\nint kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {\n    int count = 1;\n    stack<pair<TreeNode*, int>> stk;\n    stk.push({root, 0});\n    while (!stk.empty()) {\n        auto node = stk.top().first;\n        int visit = stk.top().second;\n        stk.pop();\n        if (!node) continue;\n        if (visit == 0) {\n            stk.push({node, 1});\n            stk.push({node->left, 0});\n        } else { //visit == 1\n            if (count == k) return node->val;\n            count++;\n            stk.push({node->right, 0});\n        }\n    }\n    return -1;\n}\n\n```\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)\n\nA solution:\n\n```cpp\nbool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {\n    int lastVal;\n    bool init = false;\n\n    stack<pair<TreeNode*, int>> stk;\n    stk.push({root, 0});\n    while (!stk.empty()) {\n        TreeNode* node = stk.top().first;\n        int visit = stk.top().second;\n        stk.pop();\n        if (!node) continue;\n        if (visit == 0) {\n            stk.push({node, 1});\n            stk.push({node->left, 0});\n        } else { //second visit\n            if (!init) {\n                init = true;\n                lastVal = node->val;\n            } else {\n                if (node->val <= lastVal) return false;\n                lastVal = node->val;\n            }\n            stk.push({node->right, 0});\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\n```\n\n### Postorder traversal practice problems\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)\n\nThis problem asks to check if a binary tree is balanced. It requires passing information back from the children to the parent node in a postorder traversal. Passing information from the children to the parent is easy with recursion. It can be done both with return values or with parameters passed by reference. For this problem we need to pass two things: a `bool` indicating if the subtree is balanced, and an `int` indicating its height. I use a reference parameter for the latter (returning a `pair<bool,int>` would be cleaner).\n\n```cpp\nbool isBalancedRec(TreeNode* root, int& height) {\n  if (!root) {\n    height = 0;\n    return true;\n  }\n  int lHeight, rHeight;\n  bool lBal = isBalancedRec(root->left, lHeight);\n  bool rBal = isBalancedRec(root->right, rHeight);\n  height = max(lHeight, rHeight) + 1;\n  return lBal && rBal && abs(lHeight - rHeight) <= 1;\n}\n\nbool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {\n  int height;\n  return isBalancedRec(root, height);\n}\n\n```\n\nPassing information from the children to the parent in an iterative implementation is more intricate. There are three general approaches:\n\n1.  Use a hash table mapping each node to the information.\n\nThis is the easiest way, but also the most expensive. While the asymptotic runtime is still linear, hash tables generally have significant constant factors.\n\n```cpp\nbool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {\n    stack<pair<TreeNode*, int>> stk;\n    stk.push({root, 0});\n\n    unordered_map<TreeNode*, int> height;\n    height[NULL] = 0;\n\n    while (!stk.empty()) {\n        TreeNode* node = stk.top().first;\n        int visit = stk.top().second;\n        stk.pop();\n        if (!node) continue;\n        if (visit == 0) {\n            stk.push({node, 1});\n            stk.push({node->right, 0});\n            stk.push({node->left, 0});\n        } else { // visit == 1\n            int lHeight = height[node->left], rHeight = height[node->right];\n            if (abs(lHeight - rHeight) > 1) return false;\n            height[node] = max(lHeight, rHeight) + 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\n```\n\n2.  Add a field to the definition of the node structure for the information needed.\n\nThen, we can read it from the parent node by traversing the children's pointers. In Leetcode we cannot modify the `TreeNode` data structure so, to illustrate this approach, I build a new tree first with a new struct:\n\n```cpp\nstruct MyNode {\n    int val;\n    int height;\n    MyNode *left;\n    MyNode *right;\n    MyNode(TreeNode* node): val(node->val), height(-1), left(NULL), right(NULL) {\n        if (node->left) left = new MyNode(node->left);\n        if (node->right) right = new MyNode(node->right);\n    }\n};\n\nbool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {\n    if (!root) return true;\n    MyNode* myRoot = new MyNode(root);\n    stack<pair<MyNode*, int>> stk;\n    stk.push({myRoot, 0});\n    while (!stk.empty()) {\n        MyNode* node = stk.top().first;\n        int visit = stk.top().second;\n        stk.pop();\n        if (!node) continue;\n        if (visit == 0) {\n            stk.push({node, 1});\n            stk.push({node->right, 0});\n            stk.push({node->left, 0});\n        } else { // visit == 1\n            int lHeight = 0, rHeight = 0;\n            if (node->left) lHeight = node->left->height;\n            if (node->right) rHeight = node->right->height;\n            if (abs(lHeight - rHeight) > 1) return false;\n            node->height = max(lHeight, rHeight) + 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\n```\n\n3.  Pass the information through an additional stack.\n\nThis is the most efficient, but one must be careful to keep both stacks in synch. When processing a node, that node first pops the information from its children, and then pushes its own info for its parent. Here is a solution (with eager NULL-pointer detection):\n\n```cpp\nbool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {\n    if (!root) return true;\n    stack<pair<TreeNode*, int>> stk;\n    stk.push({root, 0});\n\n    stack<int> heights;\n\n    while (!stk.empty()) {\n        TreeNode* node = stk.top().first;\n        int visit = stk.top().second;\n        stk.pop();\n        if (visit == 0) {\n            stk.push({node, 1});\n            if (node->right) stk.push({node->right, 0});\n            if (node->left) stk.push({node->left, 0});\n        } else { // visit == 1\n            int rHeight = 0, lHeight = 0;\n            if (node->right) {\n                rHeight = heights.top();\n                heights.pop();\n            }\n            if (node->left) {\n                lHeight = heights.top();\n                heights.pop();\n            }\n            if (abs(lHeight - rHeight) > 1) return false;\n            heights.push(max(lHeight, rHeight) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\n```\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)\n\nThis problem also requires passing information from the children to the parent in a postorder traversal. Here is a solution using the third approach again, but this time with lazy NULL-pointer detection. Note that we push a 0 to the `depths` stack when we extract a NULL pointer from the main stack, and during processing we always do two pops regardless of the number of non-NULL children:\n\n```cpp\nint diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {\n    stack<pair<TreeNode*,int>> stk;\n    stk.push({root, 0});\n\n    stack<int> depths;\n    int res = 0;\n\n    while (!stk.empty()) {\n        TreeNode* node = stk.top().first;\n        int visit = stk.top().second;\n        stk.pop();\n        if (!node) {\n            depths.push(0);\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (visit == 0) {\n            stk.push({node, 1});\n            stk.push({node->right, 0});\n            stk.push({node->left, 0});\n        } else { //visit == 1\n            int rDepth = depths.top();\n            depths.pop();\n            int lDepth = depths.top();\n            depths.pop();\n            int depth = max(lDepth, rDepth) + 1;\n            depths.push(depth);\n            int dia = lDepth + rDepth;\n            res = max(res, dia);\n        }\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\n```\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-tilt/](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-tilt/)\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/most-frequent-subtree-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-frequent-subtree-sum/)\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree/)\n\n## Traversals in n-ary Trees\n\nSo far, we have looked at binary trees. In an n-ary tree, each node has an arbitrary number of children.\n\n```cpp\nstruct Node {\n    int val;\n    vector<Node*> children;\n    Node(int val): val(val), children(0) {}\n};\n\n```\n\nFor n-ary trees, preorder traversal is also straightforward, and inorder traversal is not defined.\n\nFor postorder traversal, we can use a visit-number flag again. Two visits suffice for each node: one to push all the children into the stack, and another to process the node itself. I do not include the code here because it is very similar to the binary tree case.\n\nConsider a more complicated setting where we need to compute something at the node after visiting each child. Let's call this \"interleaved traversal\". I use `process(node, i)` as placeholder for the computation done before visiting the i-th child. Here is the recursive implementation and the corresponding iterative one using visit-number flags.\n\n```cpp\n//recursive\nvoid interleavedTraversal(Node* root) {\n  if (!root) return;\n  int n = root->children.size();\n  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    process(root, i);\n    interleavedTraversal(root->children[i]);\n  }\n}\n\n//iterative\nvoid interleavedTraversal(Node* root) {\n  stack<pair<TreeNode*, int>> stk;\n  stk.push({root, 0});\n  while (!stk.empty()) {\n    TreeNode* node = stk.top().first;\n    int visit = stk.top().second;\n    stk.pop();\n    if (!node) continue;\n    int n = node->children.size();\n    if (visit < n) {\n      stk.push({node, visit+1});\n      process(node, visit);\n      stk.push({node->children[visit], 0});\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n### N-ary tree practice problems\n\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/)\n*   [https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal/](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal/)\n\n## An Alternative Way of Passing the Visit Flag\n\nThe common framework to all our solutions has been to pass a visit-number flag along with the nodes on the stack. User \"heiswyd\" on leetcode posted [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/discuss/45582/A-real-Postorder-Traversal-.without-reverse-or-insert-4ms) an alternative way to pass the flag implicitly: initially, it pushes each node on the stack twice. Then, it can distinguish between the first visit and the second visit by checking whether the node that has just been extracted from the stack matches the node on top of the stack. This happens only when we extract the first of the two occurrences. Post-order traversal looks like this:\n\n```cpp\nvoid postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\n  stack<TreeNode*> stk;\n  stk.push(root);\n  stk.push(root);\n  while (!stk.empty()) {\n    TreeNode* node = stk.top();\n    stk.pop();\n    if (!node) continue;\n    if (!stk.empty() and stk.top() == node) {\n      stk.push(node->right);\n      stk.push(node->right);\n      stk.push(node->left);\n      stk.push(node->left);\n    } else {\n      process(node);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nIt is cool, but I prefer passing the flag explicitly for clarity.",

The problem? I hadn't taken my data structures and algorithms class yet. My GPA took a colossal hit that semester as I spent way too much time cutting class to watch YouTube lectures on sorting algorithms and NP-hard problems in an attempt to prepare for my interview. The interview day came, and I had two back-to-back meetings with di $ erent Googlers. I described the optimal solution for my # rst interview, which I nervously coded in C++ with a hashmap—but then the second inter- viewer stumped me with a binary tree question 5 . After much fumbling, the interviewer walked me through a viable way to solve the problem, which I coded, but I knew I had bombed my chance at a Google internship. A few years later, I passed Google’s full-time interviews twice—declining the # rst o $ er for a remote role at Salesforce and accepting the second for a permanent position at Google. ALINE After graduating from MIT, I spent three years cooking professionally. While my culinary detour could # ll a book, I wasn’t good enough at it to make it a career. Out of money, I returned to coding. Coming o $ three years of & ipping pans, chopping food, and drinking nightly, I found myself back in a well-lit o % ce, standing at a whiteboard, asked to reverse a linked list. Not only had I forgotten what these interviews were like (I was expecting to talk about my past projects), but I completely blanked on what a linked list was, much less how to reverse one. And this particular interview was with Sasha Aickin, Red # n’s CTO, back when they were like # ve people. It’s one of the things I still kick myself for, every now and again. To his credit, Sasha patiently explained how linked lists work, and, through a series of hints, got me to change pointer directions. I clumsily erased and redrew arrowheads, but I don’t think I wrote much code. It was too little, too late. I never forgot how shitty failing that interview felt. I also never forgot how gracious Sasha was, in the face of my failure, and how he patiently walked me through the problem by asking leading questions. Both of those experiences helped me come up with the idea for interviewing.io: a place where people could fail privately, without the stigma, and learn from those failures, by pairing with kind, empathetic people who care. NIL Nil insists that he’s never failed an interview. We would like to clarify that it’s because he’s only done one —and passed. True to his name, Nil has exactly zero failure stories to share. Classic edge case. 4 For the curious, I sent over 100+ cold email messages to former alumni until someone was willing to refer me. Even back then, I was using the techniques we show you in this book. 5 I was asked to compute the maximum sum of any path in the tree, which did not necessarily start at the root but could include it. For a variant of that problem, see Problem 35.1: Aligned Chain (pg 436).",

      "content": "I C H A P T E R 0 W H Y J O B S E A R C H E S S U C K Job searches suck— especially for engineers, who are, by and large, rational, well-intentioned people who expect the world to function according to some set of predictable rules. Why do job searches suck so much? • Job searches are not deterministic, and neither are interview outcomes. In job searches, e $ ort doesn’t always correlate with results. For technical interviews speci # cally, there’s little predictability in how the same person will perform from interview to interview (pg 26). • No feedback loop. When you apply online and don't get a response, you can't tell if you weren’t a # t or if no one even saw your application. Your insecurities can convince you that not only did a human look, but they quickly sized you up, saw right through you, and lasered in on every single & aw to conclude (correctly, in your mind) that you’re un # t for the job. When you interview, whether you pass or get rejected, you often don’t know why, which makes it di % cult to know how to prepare the next time. • The content of your resume is often eclipsed by the brands in it. If you don’t have brand-name companies or schools, it’s much harder to get noticed. Recruiters are notoriously bad at making value judgments based on resumes 1 . Despite these shortcomings, resumes are still the gold standard, and that means candidates from non-traditional backgrounds enter the game with a signi # cant disadvantage. • To get in the door, you very likely have to know someone. Surprisingly, this is even true for candidates who look good on paper; recruiters often ignore online applications because the signal-to-noise ratio is so poor. But it’s especially true if you don’t look good on paper. • Technical interviews are notoriously ! awed and not representative of the actual engineering work you do every day. This one is especially rough, and it bears out in our data. Senior engineers often do worse than juniors in their # rst few interviews because junior engineers have more recently completed an algorithms class or have done extensive interview prep. Senior engineers have been in the trenches, often focusing on building applications; there are very few engineering roles where you’re doing the types of academic problems that you get in interviews day in and day out. These are just a few of the challenges, but the strategies in this book will help you navigate them and achieve success—however you de # ne it. Given all these & aws, you might ask: How did we get here, where our technical interviews feel so divorced from the work and so unpredictable in their outcomes? For that, let’s take a brief look at the history of technical interviewing. 1 See https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/qhg5jo/this\\_resume\\_got\\_me\\_an\\_interview/ C H A P T E R 1 I C H A P T E R 1 I C H A P T E R 1 A B R IEF H IS TO RY O F T ECHNI C AL IN T ERV IE WS A de # nitive work on the history of technical interviewing was surprisingly hard to # nd, but we were able to piece together a narrative by scouring books like How Would You Move Mount Fuji , Programming Interviews Exposed , and the bounty of the internets. The story goes something like this. Technical interviewing has its roots as far back as the 1950s, at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories in Mountain View, California. William Shockley’s 1 interviewing methodology came out of the need to keep up with the innovative, rapidly moving, Cold War-fueled tech sector, something that traditional hiring approaches taken from established, skills-based assembly line industries simply couldn’t handle. And so, Shockley relied on questions that could gauge analytical ability, intellect, and potential quickly. One canonical question 2 in this category has to do with coins: You have eight identical-looking coins, except one is lighter than the rest. Figure out which one it is with just two weighings on a pan balance. The techniques that Shockley developed were adopted by Microsoft during the 1990s, as the success of the desktop computer, and later, the # rst dot-com boom spurred an explosion in tech hiring. Like Shockley, Microsoft also needed to quickly and scalably assess high volumes of candidates for potential. As soft- ware engineering became increasingly complex, it was no longer possible to have a few centralized expert programmers manage the design and then delegate away the minutiae. Even rank-and- # le developers needed to be able to produce under a variety of rapidly evolving conditions, where just mastery of speci # c skills wasn’t enough. The puzzle format, in particular, was easy to standardize because individual hiring managers didn’t have to come up with their own interview questions, and a company could quickly build up its own interchangeable question repository. Over time, most companies did away with puzzle questions 3 for engineers, and moved to algorithmic questions: these questions seemed more relevant but still assessed problem-solving skills. At many top companies, such as Google, this need for interchangeable parts ultimately carried over to the interview process as well—rather than having individual teams run their own processes and pipelines, 1 We are acutely aware that this is the same William Shockley who became the poster boy for eugenics. He was a pretty awful person. 2 A # rst attempt—if you're an engineer—is to do something akin to binary search: split the coins into two sets of four coins each. Then, take the lighter set, and divide it into two sets of two coins each. Then, split in half again. But that will be three weighings, not two. To reduce a weighing, consider that the balance will also tell us if the sets are equal. We can divide the coins into three sets. 3 https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html 20 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ERV I E W ▸ U G LY T R U T H S & H I D D EN R E ALI T I E S View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co companies standardized it. This way, in addition to questions, you could e $ ectively plug and play the inter- viewers themselves—any interviewer within your org could be quickly trained up and assigned to speak with any candidate, independent of the prospective team. At the same time, companies didn’t always create incentives for engineers to work hard at being good interviewers, and as you’ll see later in this book, we believe that much of the & ak that algorithmic interviews get is due to the interviewers conducting them (and, often, lack of training or proper incentives). So where does this leave us? Technical interviews are, at best, a proxy for the day-to-day tasks that a software engineer actually does, and not all interviewers are good. But, regardless, do technical interviews work? Well, that's complicated and depends a lot on your de # nition of \"work.\" For whom, the candidate or the company? For what type of company? Compared to what? We would argue that interviewing as a whole is & awed, and it's really a matter of picking your poison . However, even the most ardent defenders 4 of these sorts of technical interviews agree that false nega- tives—great engineers who get rejected—are common. FAANGs and other companies who adopt these processes tolerate a high false negative rate, under the rationale that it's better to reject a good candidate than to hire a bad one. The process is optimized to reduce false positives. For you, the candidate, that kind of sucks. But it is what it is, and that's what this book is here for: to help you avoid being one of those false negatives. 4 Let's call out the elephant in the room. Some might assume that, as authors of a coding interview book, we must adamantly believe in the value of coding interviews. Not so. Not only has our intimate look at coding interviews exposed many & aws, but the entire existence of coding interview prep means that coding interviews are, at least, a little bit broken. C H A P T E R 2 I C H A P T E R 2 I C H A P T E R 2 WHAT'S BROKEN ABOUT CODING INTERVIEWS This chapter dives into the systemic & aws of technical interviews, from the prevalence of bad questions and bad interviewers to the randomness of interview outcomes and the growing interview-industrial complex. But it’s not all doom and gloom. Once you understand the challenges and accept that the system is & awed, you’ll be able to operate within it and win (and do so with con # dence and integrity). IT’S NOT THE WORK YOU DO EVERY DAY One of the most persistent critiques of technical interviews is that they feel disconnected from the work you do every day. If interviews were like the work you did every day, we’d expect that senior engineers would outperform juniors in interviews. As it turns out, that’s not the case: frustratingly, the more experienced you are, the worse you perform. We actually have data for this. If you look at performance in their # rst mock interview on interviewing.io, junior engineers signi # cantly outperform senior ones. In the upcoming graph, you can see the average score that candidates got in their # rst mock interview on interviewing.io, broken out by seniority. Not only do junior engineers signi # cantly outperform experienced engineers, 1 but experienced engineers perform the worst out of all the groups. 1 At this point, you’re probably thinking that the bar is di $ erent for more junior engineers. At some companies, it is. At some, it is not. Our interviewers know the experience level of their candidates and adjust their bar accordingly when giving feedback. With that in mind, new grads likely do the best in interviews because they’re fresh o $ a data structures and algorithms course. 22 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ER V I E W ▸ U G LY T R U T H S & H I D D EN R E ALI T I E S View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co This e $ ect gets less pronounced as people practice more; once everyone has done a bunch of mock inter- views, they all roughly converge, as you can see in the next graph.

CHAP T ER 2 ▸ W HAT ' S B R O K EN AB O U T CO D I N G I N T ER V I E WS 23 You might also notice in this graph that it takes about # ve mock interviews, on average, to start passing these interviews (pg 40). BAD QUESTIONS ! AND MEMORIZATION OVER UNDERSTANDING \" There is so much vitriol targeted toward technical interview questions that rehashing it in detail probably isn’t worth the paper this book is printed on. If you’ve ever read any thread on Hacker News about interviewing, you know the main points: 2 • Questions are too academic and obscure. You’ve probably never had to invert a binary tree at work. • Bad questions. Many questions require a serendipitous “Ah-ha!” moment to solve, which even the best engineers may not be able to guarantee. Some questions aren’t well-formulated or require too much domain-speci # c knowledge. • Too much memorization. With how interviewing works today, it’s rational to memorize a bunch of common questions, which turns the exercise into a test of memorization rather than understanding or ability. We do not disagree with any of these points, and yes, these & aws are real. We’ve already talked about how we got here and why technical interviews are the way they are. It’s easier for huge companies to scale if they can reduce interviewer training time and not have to come up with original questions/use LeetCode questions verbatim. Sadly, smaller companies often “cargo cult” large company practices, not realizing that they hire good candidates despite their processes and not because of them. It's also true that memorizing helps a lot. On interviewing.io, after every interview, both interviewers and interviewees # ll out a feedback form. One of the things we ask interviewees is whether they’ve seen this question before. We don’t share whether they have or not with interviewers, so there’s no reason to lie. Here is a graph of the pass rate for algorithmic interviews as a function of whether candidates have seen the question before. As you can see, familiarity with a question before gives you a serious edge in interviews: you are 33% more likely to pass. We expect that this disparity would be even higher if we had rephrased our feedback form to say something like, “Have you practiced this question before?” 2 We’ve also surveyed our users, as part of some research we did to # gure out what makes someone a good interviewer: https://interviewing.io/blog/best-technical-interviews-common 24 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ERV I E W ▸ U G LY T R U T H S & H I D D EN R E ALI T I E S View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co The fact that memorizing questions gives you an edge is ironic, given that the whole purpose of modern technical interviewing is to evaluate one’s ability to think like an engineer, rather than come to the table with a bunch of speci # c skills. It’s also one of the things that makes it harder to stomach practicing for interviews. It’s a tough pill to swallow to know that, ultimately, you’re competing with memorizers. In this book, we’ll arm you with the kind of foundational understanding that will make memorization less important (but will be just as e $ ective at improving your performance). BAD INTERVIEWERS WHO DON’T WANT TO BE THERE Good interviewers can get good signal from a bad question. Bad interviewers cannot even get good signal from a good question. For a good interviewer, the question is just a tool to guide the discus- sion into interesting areas. For bad interviewers, the question is an absolute to which they must hear the exact answer they have in mind. Jos Visser, Member of Technical Sta $ at OpenAI, and formerly of Google, Facebook, and Amazon Yes, bad questions are bad. However, bad interviewers are, in our minds, the biggest problem with technical interviews. A terrible question, in the hands of a skilled, engaged interviewer, can yield meaningful signal. A great question asked by an unskilled, disconnected interviewer will always be bad. We talked about how large companies adopted modern technical interviewing in part because of the “interchangeable parts” approach to provisioning interviewers. However, human beings are not gears or sprockets—each comes with their own unique hangups and proclivities. It’s naive to think that you can swap one interviewer for another and achieve the same result. In our experience hiring professional mock interviewers, we saw very quickly that whether some- one likes to conduct interviews is bimodal: either they love it or they hate it, with not much in between. The people who like interviewing tend to enjoy teaching. They tend to have higher-than-average empathy, they remember a time when they were on the other side of the table, and they want to make that experi- ence less painful for their candidates. They also tend to approach interviews with a certain curiosity. They are curious about novel ways to solve the problem, about new rabbit holes their candidates will inevitably go down, and about the candidates themselves. The people who hate interviewing treat it as a disruption—a necessary evil between shipping features. They do the bare minimum, and it shows. Over the years, we've listened to a lot of interviews. You can immediately identify when an interviewer is checked out. You’ll hear them typing. You’ll hear them go silent for a while. They’ll often need to ask the candidate to repeat themselves. You certainly won’t hear them collaborating with their candidate or gently guiding them away from a perilous rabbit hole. Most of us have been on the receiving end of an interviewer’s callous indi $ erence and know what it feels like. CHAP T ER 2 ▸ W HAT ' S B R O K EN AB O U T CO D I N G I N T ER V I E WS 25 Bad interviewers are common across companies, even top-tier ones, 3 and there is an added complication: companies don’t usually track who their best interviewers are, 4 nor do they reward them. Sadly, it’s often the opposite—bad interviewers get rewarded because they focus on writing code instead of conducting interviews. In other words, curmudgeons who alienate their recruiting team (and get scheduled less often as a result) get rewarded. Engineers who end up being less present in their interviews because their mind is elsewhere, still churning through the code they were writing when they got interrupted, get rewarded. In the rare instances where we’ve seen companies really care about interviewer quality, it’s because an eng leader there has taken it upon themselves, as a labor of love. Why does it matter if an interviewer is bad, outside of it being a poor experience for candidates? In this graph, you can see the average interview pass rates on interviewing.io, broken out by interviewer quality. 5 Interviewer quality matters because the purpose of a technical interview is not to see if you can get the perfect answer. You’re not just solving a coding problem online by yourself. As such: • Bad interviewers miss out on critical two-way interactions with the candidate. You’re meant to discuss approaches with your interviewer and ask questions, all in the service of determining if you’re the kind of person who can pick up new skills in a rapidly changing landscape and work well with other smart people. When your interviewer is not holding up their end, it’s much harder for you to hold up yours, and it turns into a contest of who’s memorized the most questions. • Bad interviewers are incentivized to be unnecessarily harsh. Better to say no to a good candidate than risk hiring a bad one, right? 3 Some people assume that top-tier companies invest more into interviewer training than others. In our experience, that isn’t true. We won’t throw speci # c companies under the bus in this book, but if you read interviewing.io’s guide to FAANG interview processes (https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process), you’ll see how much or how little some of them invest in interviewer training. 4 https://interviewing.io/blog/best-technical-interviews-common 5 We determine quality as a function of how highly rated interviewers are by their candidates with respect to question quality, hint quality, and how excited the candidate would be to work with that person. It’s a “candidate experience” score, in other words. Candidates submit these ratings before they know how they did. This graph is also not about interviewer leniency—for what it’s worth, the best-calibrated interviewers tend to be the best-rated, and those who are too lenient tend to be among the worst.",

For all their perceived objectivity (and certainly they’re more objective than ones where you talk about your experience), coding interviews are a complex interaction between two humans. When one of the parties isn’t truly present, the candidate pipeline su $ ers, and you end up with fewer candidates to choose from and, ultimately, worse hires. NON ' DETERMINISTIC OUTCOMES Anyone who’s done multiple technical interviews has probably felt in their gut that outcomes are somewhat arbitrary. So much depends on serendipity and, well, clicking! Did you click with your interviewer? Did some- thing click in your head at the right time when trying to solve the problem? If you’ve felt like this, you’re not alone, and we have the data to prove it. On interviewing.io, after every interview, you get a technical score from your interviewer, on a scale of 1 to 4. The same candidate can do multiple interviews, each of which is with a di $ erent interviewer and/or di $ erent company, and this opens the door for some pretty interesting and somewhat controlled comparative analysis. With that in mind, we looked at how the same person performed from interview to interview. We analyzed interviewing.io’s data to understand how individuals performed across multiple inter- views (for this analysis, we included people who did between 3 and 20 interviews). Each circle or diamond represents people with that speci # c average score and standard deviation across their interviews. The y-axis is the standard deviation of performance; a higher standard deviation re & ects more volatility. Some surprising takeaways from this analysis: CHAP T ER 2 ▸ W HAT ' S B R O K EN AB O U T CO D I N G I N T ER V I E WS 27 • Only 25% of people are consistent from interview to interview (standard dev of <= 0.5). Everyone else is all over the place. • 64% of the people who scored at least one 4 have also scored at least one 1 or one 2. So, what did the most highly volatile performers have in common? The answer appears to be, well, nothing. About half were working at top companies. About 60% had attended top schools. And years of experience didn’t have much to do with it either—a plurality of interviewees had between 2 and 6 years of experience, with the rest all over the board (varying between 1 and 20 years). When we corrected for interviewer strictness, the e $ ect didn’t go away either. Why is this bad? This inconsistency means randomness signi # cantly impacts your career. In a way, interviews serve the same function as standardized tests—giving an organization a way to make a value judgment about someone’s ability relatively quickly and without a lot of priors, in a way that’s consistent and repeatable. For all their & aws and biases, standardized testing providers have made a lot of e $ ort to make sure that their results are repeatable because their results often determine the social mobility and livelihoods of millions of students every year. Even though they have a similar impact on outcomes for millions of engineers, tech companies have not done the same for their interviews. BUCKETED SCORING Imagine that we wanted to evaluate whether students in a given classroom were tall or short. But rather than measuring people’s heights, we # rst bucketed them into “very short,” “short,” “tall,” or “very tall.” Inevitably, there will be many cases where two students are nearly the same height, but a few millimeters make the di $ erence between “short” and “tall.” Any bucketed scoring will lose precision and create arbitrariness, but it’s even worse when we have few buckets and split the middle zone—which is common. That is, if, rather than providing a bucket for “average height” (where most people might fall), we split these people into “short” and “tall” depending on whether they cross some threshold. Now, we don’t just have some arbitrary scores; we have a lot of them. This is e $ ectively what’s happening in many technical interviews. In fact, it can be a triple-whammy. • Bucketed Scoring: Interviewers don’t score you as a 2.6; almost always, interviewers are forced into bucketed scores, such as 1, 2, 3, or 4 (or its qualitative equivalent: strong no-hire, no-hire, hire, strong hire). • Risk-Averse Scoring: Interviewers are encouraged to be risk-averse: “better to reject a good one than hire a bad one,” they say. That 2.6 interview is more likely to be reported as a 2 than a 3. • Splitting the Middle: In many cases, interviewers are bucketed into just four buckets— with no place for \"average\" or \"maybe.\" The average score is often around a 2.5 to 2.7, so a four-point scale splits the middle candidates. This means that a lot of people will get rounded up or down into “hire” or “no-hire.” A candidate who gets {3.2, 3.3, 2.7, 3.4} on a four-point scale may be hired, but the candidate who gets {3/ hire, 3/hire, 2/no-hire, 3/hire} (a possible risk-averse rounding equivalent) may not be. We've e $ ectively lost the information that the \"no-hire\" was actually really close to a \"hire.\" No matter how you bucket, bucketed scoring e $ ectively forces interviewers to translate very typical scores into something more extreme and loses # delity in the process. No wonder we have so much variability in interviews! 28 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ERV I E W ▸ U G LY T R U T H S & H I D D EN R E ALI T I E S View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co INTERVIEW PREP BEGETS INTERVIEW PREP Technical interviewing has given rise to a booming preparation industry. This is somewhat ironic, as it defeats the purpose of this form of interviewing; the goal was to understand the candidate's aptitude, independent of what they currently know. The reality is that—as we've shown—interview prep works . We might not like it, but people do better with preparation. That's why interview prep is a multi-billion dollar industry, including everything from books and courses to asynchronous coding challenges and mock interviews. This also means that you are being compared to candidates who are prepping for interviews (and, in many cases, simply memorizing a ton of questions), which means that the expectations for you have gone up too. What do you do about this? You, of course, prepare for interviews too. It's an unfortunate cycle; interview prep begets interview prep. 6 But for the record, memorizing problems without also working on understanding goes against our preparation philosophy, and it’s honestly not that e $ ective. All that said, it’s time to change our lens and talk about how to work the system. Technical interviews are here to stay, and if you want a job at a top-tier tech company, you have to jump through this hoop. 6 Would it be better if we did the impossible and magically got rid of all interview prep? Probably not. Before today's industry, there were still some books and resources—but it relied more on word of mouth and \"inside\" sources (friends telling you what to expect). This favored people with connections. The bar might have been lower, but the playing # eld was more unfair.",

Charlie Munger It is di % cult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it. Upton Sinclair Even though recruiters try to position themselves as your advocate, remember this: recruiters are not your friend, and they don’t work for you. I (Aline) used to be a recruiter. I ran my own third-party agency, and I also worked in-house before starting interviewing.io. That means I’ve had to struggle with the tangled incentive structure 1 that comes with being a recruiter. There’s always tension; recruiters are, by and large, good human beings who genuinely want to help their candidates, but they also have an employer they’re beholden to, as well as a comp/bonus structure that rewards certain behaviors, some of which run counter to candidates’ best interests. There’s some distinction between in-house recruiters and third-party recruiters (recruiters who work for an agency that does placement, rather than a speci # c company that’s hiring engineers). THIRD ' PARTY RECRUITERS Working with third-party recruiters (also known as agency recruiters) is, at best, mixed. The most important thing to realize about them is that you are not the customer. The employer is. As such, even when they're paid a commission based on your salary, their incentives are, at best, sometimes aligned with yours. Ultimately, a recruiter's incentive is to get the deal done , not to get you the best possible deal. Here’s why. A recruiter, depending on market conditions, gets anywhere from 8% - 25% of a candidate’s base salary when they make a placement. However, that cut is going to the recruiting agency as a whole rather than to the individual recruiter; you will almost always end up working with large agencies rather than a single person. Let's say that you get an o $ er. You talk to your third-party recruiter and tell them that you would like more money. The recruiter may go to the hiring manager and try to advocate for you, but they're not going to 1 https://blog.alinelerner.com/if-youre-an-engineer-who-wants-to-start-a-recruiting-business-read-this- # rst/ What Recruiters Won’t Tell You 30 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ERV I E W ▸ U G LY T R U T H S & H I D D EN R E ALI T I E S View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co push very hard because the incremental di $ erence in their cut is going to be pretty small 2 , and to them the thing that matters is making the hire. After all, they're evaluated on the number of hires they make, # rst and foremost, independent of compensation. Third-party recruiters are incentivized to get the deal done, not to risk the deal by negotiating hard for you. This means: • If they have multiple clients potentially matching the same company, and they know you're less likely to take their o $ er, they'll # ght for the other candidates more than you. • They may expose information to the company that reveals whether you'll demand a high salary. Remem- ber: they're paid by the company, not you. If the company likes them, that's good for them. • They may encourage you to take a lower salary. Sure, they get a slightly higher commission if you negotiate a higher salary, but they get no commission until the deal is done. • They may encourage an employer to lowball you, if they think you’ll take it. 3 So, when you work with third-party recruiters: • Do not tell them anything about your job search. • Do not share your compensation history/expectations. • Always deal directly with the companies they introduce you to, once you establish a point of contact there. • Assume that anything you tell your recruiter is going to get back to every company you’re working with. IN ' HOUSE RECRUITERS Some in-house recruiters get a bonus for hires, but this bonus is rarely tied to your compensation. In fact, in some cases, they may get a bigger bonus if they’re able to negotiate you down. At big companies, in particular, in-house recruiters follow a playbook, and are evaluated accordingly. They’re trained to make o $ ers within speci # c bands, and they’re trained to mobilize such that they don’t lose candi- dates to other big companies; if you wave a Facebook countero $ er in front of Google, they will act. If you tell them you’re interviewing at a startup, they will not, because they know that startups don’t pay as much. Because of this playbook 4 —and because they are working for the employer—their incentives do not align with yours. They’re incentivized, # rst and foremost, to follow the rules their head of department sets for them. This is true for how they evaluate candidates, who they let through, and how they read resumes. And it’s de # nitely true for how they negotiate. Generally speaking, recruiters want to help, and many are rooting for their candidates. But they’re also operating inside a box, and that box isn’t set up to put your interests # rst. 2 Understanding that, let's do the math anyway. Let’s say your o $ er has a base salary of $150k. Say that your recruiter goes to bat for you and tries to get you up to $165k. Before, the agency would have gotten paid $15k. Now the agency gets paid $16.5k. That incremental $1.5k isn’t worth risking a deal over (even a few thousand dollars would not justify jeopardizing the deal). On top of that, the individual recruiter is only going to maybe get a few hundred dollars total from that increase. 3 Why would a recruiter recommend that an employer not pay you more? It seems counterintuitive, but remember that the employer is their customer, not you. A savvy business person will often take a short-term hit in the service of building an enduring relationship with their customer. Telling an employer that they don’t need to pay a candidate more (even though paying the candidate more would get the recruiter marginally more money) builds trust and makes it more likely that that employer will keep coming back to them for future searches. Employers often work with several agencies at once and cycle between agencies, so anything agencies can do to retain employers is a win. 4 For more insight, watch this video on how recruiting leaders think about looking at resumes, debrie # ng interviews, and extending o $ ers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHSufqvgUqY CHAP T ER 3 ▸ W HAT R ECR U I T ER S WO N ' T T ELL YO U 31 A NOTE ABOUT IN ! HOUSE RECRUITER TENURES Many recruiters at FAANG companies are contractors. The longer a contractor works, the more their role may resemble that of a full-time employee. To avoid legal risks, companies often limit contract durations to around 6 months. While this practice is most common in California due to its strict labor laws, similar limitations are applied in other states, though the typical contract length may vary. Why do recruiter tenures matter to you? • Never assume that the recruiter you're talking to now will still be there in a few months, when you're ready to interview. • Build good rapport with your recruiter. Odds are good that, even if you don't pursue their current company, you might be interested in their future company. • Don't lie about other o $ ers—it’s not super likely your recruiter is checking whether you have the o $ ers you say you do, but chances are, because recruiters have short tenures and work at lots of companies, your recruiter knows someone there. We’ve seen it happen. We’ll talk a lot more about how to work well with recruiters in future chapters, and now you’ll understand why we give the advice that we do. RECRUITERS WILL TRY TO CALL/TEXT. USE EMAIL INSTEAD. Recruiters are notorious for calling and texting instead of using email. Why? The generous interpretation is that recruiters generally want to move things along quickly. If they can get you to respond quickly, through a synchronous medium like phone or text, then they can likely move you through the process faster as well. There is one other, less generous interpretation—phone and text give recruiters the upper hand. Even the worst recruiters, if they have any work experience at all, quickly become seasoned negotiators. Even inexperienced recruiters have an edge because they are following a script and playbook. They’ve been told what to say in a variety of situations, and they interact with candidates multiple times a day, over years. You, on the other hand, do one job search every few years. Email lets you level the playing # eld. You can craft every word, and # gure out what to say and how much to reveal. Over email, you can play it cool, and you can take the time to get advice from friends or experts. When a recruiter calls you on the phone, they get your impromptu responses. They can see if you're excited about the money, and possibly get you to answer questions that you might not have otherwise answered (e.g., your salary expectations). The phone will keep you o $ balance. While texting allows you to think longer about your response, its casual nature lulls you into a false sense of security. Moreover, the fact that texts interrupt you from something else puts you at a disadvantage—when you get interrupted, your instinct is to quickly respond to make the interruption go away. But knee-jerk responses are rarely the right ones, and you end up giving away information you shouldn’t have. We encourage you to stick to email as much as possible. You will have to get on the phone eventually, of course, likely when they are ready to extend an o $ er, but you never have to text.

That’s not strictly true. As we previously discussed (pg 24), most employers don’t reward strong interview- ing skills, so interviewers have little motivation to improve. Here are some additional interviewing tropes, which may or may not be true. We’ll discuss them all and address them with data. Can you guess which ones are true? • It’s not about whether you get the right answer. Rather it’s about demonstrating your thought process. • Interviewers decide early on if you’ve passed the interview. • If you’re a great communicator and build rapport with your interviewer, you can pass the interview, even if your technical skills are wobbly. IS IT REALLY ABOUT DEMONSTRATING YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS, OR DO YOU NEED TO GET TO AN OPTIMAL SOLUTION? On interviewing.io, candidates who clearly and correctly explained their approach but failed to reach an acceptable working solution received a \"thumbs up\" only 32% of the time, compared to the platform's overall average of 51%. This means that failing to produce a working solution reduces your chances of passing the interview by 37%. 1 How Interview Replays Work and How to Use Them Interview replays come from mock interviews on interviewing.io. Replays are shared with the permission of both participants. Each replay includes the interviewer’s feedback. You can watch just the relevant snippet, but we include the entire interview. We strongly recommend pausing your reading and watching these replays. Hearing real people interview lets you learn from their mistakes—so that you aren’t doomed to repeat them. Where we know it (and where enough time has elapsed since they did mock interviews), we’ll share the candidate’s outcome. 1 To be clear, if you’ve gotten to the optimal solution and have mostly working code (maybe some small syntax errors or an o $ by one error), we believe most interviewers would still give a Hire rating. But if it’s not working, it has to be very close.

Who: Interviewer : Sta $ Software Engineer at Lyft Candidate : 4 years of experience So, why do many interviewers insist on saying that it’s about your thought process rather than the end result? That's complicated, but there are a few reasons: 1. It feels good to say. Interviewers want to believe that they're grading on something deeper and more qualitative than getting the right answers to really hard questions. 2. It is true, in a sense; interviewers prioritize your solving ability , not the answer itself. If you just spit out the right answer because you already know it, this won't be impressive to a good interviewer and could even lead you to getting eliminated for \"cheating.\" 3. It used to be even more true. As standards have increased, there has been a bit less forgiveness for a candidate who made good progress but didn't get to the best solution. The reality is that interviewers are looking for strong problem solvers, and—for a good interviewer—it is about the process, not the solution. However, it's often hard to convince them that you're a strong problem solver if you can't reach the optimal solution. Either way, this trope stresses the importance of practice—the more you practice, the faster you’ll get, and the more likely you get to an acceptable solution. FIRST IMPRESSIONS AREN'T PREDICTIVE. EARLY PERFORMANCE IS. You might have heard that the interviewers decide in the # rst few minutes whether you've passed the interview; we've certainly heard that plenty. But even supposing that's true, is it true for technical interviews? Given that technical interviews are focused on problem solving, it would be troubling if interviewers did in fact make such snap judgments before the problem solving had even happened. At interviewing.io, we looked into this claim by analyzing sentiment—interviewers can make a comment during the interview (we call these “annotations”) with an associated sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative), which the candidate will see afterwards. 34 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ER V I E W ▸ U G LY T R U T H S & H I D D EN R E ALI T I E S View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co Those who believe that the # rst impression is make-or-break might be reassured by this: the interviewer's # rst annotation is aligned with the outcome just 56% of the time—barely better than a coin & ip. The # rst annotation occurs at an average of 13 minutes into the interview, which means the chit-chat is done and we've kicked o $ the problem solving portion. We can't speak for what happens in non-eng interviews, but at least for eng interviews: no, interviewers do not decide in the # rst few minutes. Whew! However, your interviewer’s impression of you by the 18-minute mark is predictive. Figure 1. This graph is based on 7,883 interviews with annotations from the interviewing.io corpus. You can see when the # rst annotation that was predictive of the interview outcome happened. Most happen in the # rst 18 minutes. Moreover, the average sentiment gets worse over time for both successful and unsuccessful candidates, with the sharpest decline occurring in the # rst 15 minutes. CHAP T ER 4 ▸ W HAT I N T ER V I E W ER S WO N ' T T ELL YO U 35 Figure 2. This graph is based on 7,883 interviews with annotations from the interviewing.io corpus. You could interpret these # ndings cynically—all candidates do badly, and interviewers get stuck in precon- ceived (or at least early) notions. But as authors who have—collectively—spoken with thousands of candi- dates and interviewers, we see this in a more positive light. Good interviewers 2 adjust their guidance based on your performance: when you do well, they give you less assistance; when you struggle, they give you more. It's like a live version of computer adaptive testing. This means that while you might do well in the # rst 10 minutes (mostly chit-chat and explaining the problem), good interviewers will adjust so that you struggle just enough. Perhaps seeing that struggle is why sentiment generally gets more negative over time; a good interviewer is purposefully putting you into situations that challenge you, thus creating more room for negative sentiment 3 . But that’s part of the interview process. # This means, for you, don't panic when things get more challenging. Embrace the struggle . Struggling doesn't mean that you're doing poorly; it can just mean that your interviewer is doing their job. They've given a problem of appropriate di % culty and adjusted their guidance to suit your abilities. We also believe, optimistically, that it’s a good thing early-formed opinions are predictive. At the 18 minute mark, we're about 10 minutes into the problem solving portion, by which point our interviewer has seen some of our skills. If the # rst 10 minutes of problem solving were not predictive of the next 30 minutes, that would be a further indictment of the interview process. After all, it's not like we're magically becoming better or worse problem solvers, so our performance at the beginning should typically be predictive of the rest. It's good that we see consistency. It means that our interviewers, if they’re good, are actually looking at our problem solving process, not quantitative metrics like \"number of minutes to solution\" or \"did you get it perfect right away\", nor dinging us because we have some tiny bug. # This means, again, there's no reason to panic at little mistakes; these aren't making interviewers & ip & op. Not all interviewers are good interviewers (unfortunately), but still—interviewers are generally looking at your performance as a process. 2 Fortunately, this data set is limited to interviewers who were rated well by their candidates. Our interpretations of the data do not hold for bad interviewers. As we discussed earlier (pg 24), there are many bad interviewers who aren’t engaged and check out after the # rst few minutes. 3 However, this doesn't mean that you are truly doing worse. A good interviewer will also be looking at signal (pg 180), which means that they are taking into account the complexity of the problem. 36 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ERV I E W ▸ U G LY T R U T H S & H I D D EN R E ALI T I E S View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co COMMUNICATION SKILLS ARE NICE, BUT TECHNICAL SKILLS ARE NICER Communication in technical interviews boils down to two aspects: rapport-building at the start (about yourself, your projects, etc) and clear communication throughout the interview. RAPPORT ! BUILDING AT THE START Look, this isn’t the kind of thing you usually say in an interview prep book, but the chit-chat in the # rst few minutes does not matter... much . Data shows positive communication in the # rst # ve minutes increases pass rates by 6 percentage points for underperforming candidates, compared to a 25-point boost from strong technical performance. Be enthusiastic and personable, but don’t stress this unless small talk is a challenge for you. The technical stu $ really does matter more. COMMUNICATION THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW Although many candidates believe in coding as soon as possible, the data shows the opposite: successful candidates actually code slightly later (about two minutes later 4 in a one-hour interview). This di $ erence is small, but extra surprising given that many unsuccessful candidates will be quite delayed in coding because they lack a working approach. So why would coding later be linked to better outcomes? Communication, essentially. Candidates who explain their approach do better in interviews, but communication takes time. Thinking out loud is essential in technical interviews, but beyond a baseline, communication may not signi # - cantly impact outcomes—at least for roles below Sta $ . On interviewing.io, candidates are rated on technical skills, problem-solving ability, and communication skills (all on a 1 - 4 scale), alongside a pass/fail score. Our analysis found that once a candidate scores 2 / 4 in communication, additional improvements yield diminishing returns. In contrast, boosting technical or problem-solving scores by 1 or 2 points can increase the odds of passing by 1.5X to 2.4X, emphasizing the greater importance of these skills. As roles become more senior though, communication and behavioral skills play an increasingly critical role in interview outcomes. At the Sta $ level and beyond, our anecdotal experience—supported by feedback from interviewers—shows that the evaluation criteria shift signi # cantly to emphasize these skills. All that said, we can't fully tease apart technical ability and communication skills; when a candidate can't communicate their solution, interviewers are also less likely to be impressed by their approach—and they are less able to give you hints to help you along. Where does this leave you? • Don’t worry about practicing speci # cally for the # rst 5 minutes of the interview. You can prepare for it a little, but don't stress about it. • Get used to thinking out loud. • Spend the bulk of your time getting better at solving problems. Fortunately, practicing thinking out loud doesn't come at the cost of practicing solving problems. You can quite literally do them at the same time. 4 Candidates with successful interviews # rst run code 27% of the way through the interview, whereas candidates with unsuccessful interviews # rst run code 23.9% of the way into the interview. This di $ erence is small, but nonetheless statistically signi # cant. https://interviewing.io/blog/we-analyzed-thousands-of-technical-interviews-on-everything- from-language-to-code-style-here-s-what-we-found#user-content-fnref-3 C H A P T E R 5 I C H A P T E R 5 I C H A P T E R 5 M I N D S E T A N D T H E N U M B E R S G A M E No matter how good an engineer you are, if you get too much in your head during interviews, you’ll fail. We’ve seen countless candidates self-sabotage because they jumped into the interview prep material before they accepted some fundamental truths about the journey. This chapter is about how to approach these interviews, and we encourage you to take it seriously. It’s not woo-woo nonsense. It’s our way of making sure you can apply your full potential for the rest of the book. With that in mind, here are the things you need to internalize and truly believe before you begin your studies. TECHNICAL INTERVIEWING IS A NUMBERS GAME Technical interviews are a numbers game, but many engineers underestimate just how much. It takes doing many interviews, and even more importantly, access to a peer group going through the same thing, to really internalize it. Here, we’ll try to short-circuit all of that and convince you that failing an interview doesn’t re & ect on your engineering skills or potential; it’s often the byproduct of a broken system. Remember the graph (pg 26) where we showed that most people’s technical interview performance is all over the place? Here it is again (Figure 1). Only 25% of people performed consistently, and about two thirds of people who got at least one 4 also got at least one 1 or 2. Due to this inconsistency, even great engineers routinely fail interviews. This is a particularly big issue in tech- nical phone screens, where interviewers must decide if someone gets to onsite based on just one data point. Many candidates go into the process assuming it’s repeatable, like a standardized test—a reasonable but & awed assumption. The truth is, unless you’ve been through the wringer, and unless you have people around you who have also been through the wringer, you’re unlikely to realize just how unpredictable and variable the process can be. For me (Aline), this became clear when I was a student at MIT. Attending a top-tier computer science program o $ ered a number of advantages, but one of the most important (and least obvious) was access to a peer group that was going through the same things. Having this group around me meant that we could all practice with each other, share our successes and failures, and have multiple shots on goal at top companies. Everyone was interviewing everywhere, and we quickly learned that bombing a Microsoft interview did not mean that you weren’t meant to be an engineer. It just meant that you needed to work some more problems, do some more mock interviews, and try again at Google. 38 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ER V I E W ▸ U G LY T R U T H S & H I D D EN R E ALI T I E S View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co Figure 1. Standard deviation vs. mean interview performance (33,052 interviews; 7,161 interview- ees). We analyzed interviewing.io’s data to understand how individuals performed across multiple interviews (for this analysis, we included people who did between 3 and 20 interviews). Each circle or diamond represents people who had that speci # c average score and standard deviation across their interviews. One of the most critical things to internalize is that if you fail an interview, that’s all it is. It is not a well-reasoned indictment of your potential as an engineer. Keep practicing and try again. Unfortunately, dusting yourself o $ and trying again is harder for some groups than for others. PERSEVERANCE AFTER FAILURE IS HARDER FOR ENGINEERS FROM NON ' TRADITIONAL BACKGROUNDS Many years ago, we noticed that on interviewing.io, women were performing signi # cantly worse in technical interviews than men. This disparity still exists today. But before you jump to conclusions, the reason is not that women are actually technically weaker. Let us explain. Figure 2.

So, we ran an experi- ment 1 using a real-time voice modulator that could change the pitch of the user's voice (making women sound like men, and vice versa). Contrary to what we expected, masking gender had no e ff ect on interview performance. Perhaps the women were less senior? Doing di $ erent work? Nope. Neither of those factors seemed to di $ er meaningfully between groups. What was di $ erent then? Women left interviewing.io roughly seven times as often as men after they do badly in an interview. And the numbers for two bad interviews aren’t much better. 2 Figure 3. Attrition after poor interview performance. When you correct for attrition, the di $ erence between men and women goes away entirely. 3 Figure 4. Average passthrough rate by gender when correcting for people who drop out after two failures. 1 We split our users into three groups: unmodulated (the control group), modulated without pitch change (another control; we needed it because modulated voices sound somewhat processed, and the last thing we wanted was for interviewers to guess the gender of their interviewees because anyone who sounded processed and male must actually be a woman and vice versa), and modulated with pitch change. This last one was the treatment group. https:// interviewing.io/blog/voice-modulation-gender-technical-interviews 2 The di $ erences between men and women are extremely statistically signi # cant with P < 0.00001. 3 We have not studied this e $ ect in race or in socioeconomic status, but we’d expect that you’d see a disparity in persever- ance between groups, with engineers from non-traditional backgrounds being more likely to quit. 40 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ERV I E W ▸ U G LY T R U T H S & H I D D EN R E ALI T I E S View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co We are calling this out because we want it to change your behavior: everyone fails these interviews, regardless of background. If you're a woman, and very likely if you’re from a non- traditional background, know that failure isn't a career end. Accept the system's & aws and learn to navigate them. This means learning as much as you can, practicing as much as you can, then learning some more, and then practicing some more. End-to-end, the practice journey may take anywhere from two to six months, depending on where you start and your previous exposure to algorithms and data structures. But, no matter who you are, you will need to practice, and you will fail some interviews. This is an axiom of our book. It might take two failures before things turn around. It might take # fteen. But we implore you to exert yourself and keep going. If you approach technical interviewing from a place of curiosity, we promise that you’ll get through it and # nd success at the end... which brings us to our # nal point. PRACTICE IS REALLY IMPORTANT CRITICAL It's all well and good to talk about who is doing well in mock interviews, but at the end of the day, your goal is to do well in real interviews. To understand what is driving strong performance in real interviews, we surveyed interviewing.io users about how well they did in real interviews at Google, Meta, and Amazon and compared their performance at these companies against their past total interview count (both mock and real), gender, whether they had a computer science degree, and how they learned to code. The factor that stood out most was how many technical interviews an engineer had done in the past. Across all users, people who had completed # ve or more interviews had higher rates of passing a phone interview than those who had done fewer. The number of interviews mattered more than people’s starting technical pro # ciency, and it also mattered more than gender and pedigree (those factors didn’t actually matter). 4 PROBABILITY OF PASSING A TECHNICAL PHONE SCREEN 1 \" 4 INTERVIEWS BEFOREHAND 5+ INTERVIEWS BEFOREHAND Amazon 65% 81% Meta 40% 71% Google 51% 80% Figure 5. The probability of passing phone screens at Amazon, Google, and Meta, as a function of how many technical interviews candidates had done previously, based on data from interviewing. io users. Practice helps, and the “tipping point” is # ve interviews. But what, speci # cally, is it about practice that is so impactful? According to survey results, it's about direct feedback (when candidates were fortunate enough to get it; most often it was in mock interviews, rarely in real ones). Engineers typically can’t gauge how they did in interviews, 5 so they probably can’t gauge why they passed or failed—although, unfortunately, they often think they can. As a result, they are bound to over-index on the wrong things and neglect the ones that truly matter. We’ll talk more about the limited utility of using real interviews for practice in “What about using companies for practice?” on page 79 . Mock interviews o $ er direct, honest feedback from other people so that you know how you're perceived and what to improve. 4 https://interviewing.io/blog/how-know-ready-interview-faang 5 https://interviewing.io/blog/people-cant-gauge-their-own-interview-performance-and-that-makes-them-harder- to-hire",

Working for a FAANG+ means having to do algorithmic interviews, and if you're resentful of the format, you will not learn as quickly or e $ ectively. Making peace with the format—whether that's seeing its bene # ts or just putting aside your feelings—will make your preparation much more e $ ective (and probably much less unpleasant). As one engineer we know put it: \\[Practicing\\] unambiguously changed the game for me. I went from hating interviews and ranting about whiteboarding to \"If you go to med school you have to take the MCAT.\" THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL METRICS The two most important metrics to getting a job boil down to: 1. How many interviews do you have in your pipeline? 2. How good are you at passing technical interviews? Let's suppose you pass 70% of your interviews. Not bad, right? Most interviewers would like to hire you. But if a company does one phone screen plus four onsite interviews, this means that you only have a 17% chance 7 of getting an o $ er from this company. Not so good—especially if you're trying to hold out for one speci \" c company. If you can raise this from a 70% to a 90% pass rate, this means you'll get most o $ ers you try for. If that seems overwhelming, you can instead try for more interviews. With a 17% o $ er rate, you can interview with four companies and have a greater than 50% chance of at least one o $ er. In reality, you'll want to optimize both of these metrics. A pass-rate of 80% will give you an o $ er rate of 33%—and require just two companies to probably get an o $ er. Your odds of getting a better o $ er at a more desirable company only go up as you interview with more companies. To get an o $ er that you're excited about, you'll want to focus on both getting more interviews and doing better in those interviews. The goal of this book is to increase both of these metrics. 6 We’ve already talked about how, in our view, bad, unmotivated interviewers are a bigger problem than the format itself. 7 Yes, yes, this is horribly handy-wavy. It assumes a 70% pass-rate on all interviews, when in reality it might vary by company or interview type—or just luck.

They're what get you in the door! • People only skim them. These aren't necessarily con & icting, but they do seem at least somewhat at odds. Muddling all of this is the incredible amount of resources out there about optimizing resumes: books, blog posts, resume writers, free and paid resume templates, and so on. What's the truth? The truth is that recruiters don't spend too long reviewing your resume, it's hard to di $ er- entiate yourself with it, and much of what they do look for is out of your hands. This doesn't mean skip this—if you're going to spend weeks or months on interview prep, you might as well spend a little time on your resume. But realistically, this is not the place to stress. Optimize, but don't overoptimize. ▶ What about LinkedIn? While we're using the term \"resume\" here, almost everything here applies to LinkedIn. Consider LinkedIn your online resume. WHAT RECRUITERS LOOK AT In 2024, interviewing.io ran a study 1 where they asked 76 recruiters to look at resumes and indicate which candidates they’d want to interview. They were most likely to contact you if: • You look good on paper, i.e., you have top-tier companies and/or schools on your resume (in our experi- ence, companies matter more) • You belong to a group that’s been traditionally underrepresented in tech (i.e., you’re a woman or a person of color) • To some extent, if you have niche skills (e.g., ML engineering) What's missing? Things like, for example, having a quanti # able impact or demonstrating teamwork. Essen- tially, everything recruiters look for is stu $ that you either have or you don't. 1 https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin- & ip-at-judging-resumes CHAP T ER 6 ▸ R E SUM E S 45 Since you can’t magic FAANG+ experience or professional experience with niche skills, or belonging to an underrepresented group out of thin air 2 , how do you use this information to your advantage? We'll get there, but # rst you need to understand something else. Should you do side projects? As an engineer, I’d never discourage side projects—they can be fun, educational, and possibly take your career in a new direction. However, side projects are best pursued well in advance of a job search or simply because you enjoy it. Once you're actively looking for a job, your time is better spent on interview prep and outreach. You simply don't have enough time to make a cool enough project that it makes you that much more attractive to hiring managers. It isn't that these things have no value; they are just less likely to convert to a job. THEY AREN'T READING In this same study, we also learned that when recruiters do look at resumes, they spend an average of 30 seconds reviewing them. That's not enough time to read every bullet. Instead, they are mainly skimming for recognizable companies and schools. Here is an excellent example 3 —one that was successfully sent to recruiters—that makes this di $ erence very clear. This resume certainly passes the skim-test: good companies, appropriate roles, and a good university too. 2 This is why I generally view resume writers as selling snake oil. Either you have the things recruiters are looking for or you don’t. Additionally, non-technical resume writers will often focus on less relevant attributes because that's what they understand. For the most part, resume writers are a waste of time and money, and in some cases harmful. 3 https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/qhg5jo/this\\_resume\\_got\\_me\\_an\\_interview/ 46 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ERV I E W ▸ J O B SE AR CH E S, S TAR T TO FI N ISH View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co It's only when you read the resume that you learn that not only is this resume obviously fake, but it also celebrates accomplishments like \"Spread Herpes STD to 60% of intern team.\" And yet, it got a 90% callback rate. Recruiters just aren't reading the details. THEY AREN'T CONSISTENT In this same interviewing.io study, we also learned that recruiters were only slightly better than a coin & ip at identifying talent. And, what’s more, they all disagreed with each other about what a good resume looked like. 4 Recall all that resume advice you've probably heard, and stop and think: if people can't agree with each other on what makes a good resume, how can you optimize so much for this? We're saying all this not to suggest that you shouldn't care, but rather to encourage you to care a bit less . Do an adequate job and then put your focus elsewhere. AN ADEQUATE RESUME If recruiters are skimming your resume—not reading it—what do you do? You make your resume skimmable. That is, make the things recruiters are looking for—if you have them—really easy for recruiters to spot. 5 And if you don’t have these traits? It will still help you to do this. Everyone is aided by making their best stu $ easy to spot. These are the # ve easy steps to making an adequate resume: 1. Use a template. Any template will do. 2. Keep it to one or two pages. 3. Write up your work experience. Use clear, concise bullets. 4. Add your skills, education, and other sections. 5. Proofread. That's it. And, please, skip the resume writers 6 . RESUME TEMPLATES There are many templates online. Look for one which has: • Sections for Skills, Education, and Work Experience. • Columns for your companies, or something else that makes it very easy to see where you worked. • Will allow you to # t your resume on one (or two) pages. • Reasonable white space. Some resume templates put the headings like \"Skills\" and \"Experience\" as one big column, which takes up a lot of space. Unless you're struggling to # ll a single page, it's best to avoid these ones. • Uses bullets. 4 This was the second study of its kind that we did. We # rst got these results in 2014: https://blog.alinelerner.com/ resumes-suck-heres-the-data/ 5 Of course, whether you want to lead with underrepresented minority status is a personal decision. We’ve heard di $ ering opinions on this and are not here to judge. All we can do is share the data—do with it what you will. 6 While there are some resume writers who produce good work, most do not. They will waste your money since, as we've explained, they're optimizing for things that mostly don't matter. On top of this, it's not unusual that a resume writer will actually cause damage. Most are not technical and don't know how to write a technical resume. They end up & u % ng your resume up with \"leadership\" and killing o $ the technical stu $ . CHAP T ER 6 ▸ R E SUM E S 47 The vast majority of resumes either # t these criteria or can be easily modi # ed to # t them. For your convenience though, we've provided some templates online at bctci.co/resume-templates. NOT ! TOO ! LONG RESUME Resumes should be one or two pages, generally. A good rule of thumb is that if you have held multiple jobs and have 10+ years of experience, you might be able to justify two pages. Other people should generally stick with one. In fact, for the vast majority of people, it's in your best interest to stick with one page. Remember that people are only spending 30 seconds or so on your resume because all they need to decide is \"interview or no interview.\" When your resume is multiple pages, it's a lot easier to miss the highlights, like a great project or award. When it's all on one page, the best stu $ is more likely to jump out at them. If your current resume is too long Despite this advice, we routinely see resumes that are sometimes three or four pages (my record is seventeen pages... from someone with only a few years of experience!). If you have a super long resume and just don't know how to cut it down, here's our recommendation: don't cut it down. Start over! It is very di % cult to \"edit\" a resume from # ve pages down to just a page and a half. When you try to, you often # nd yourself wasting a lot of time condensing content that doesn't make much sense and isn't relevant. Just start over; it's faster. WRITING UP YOUR EXPERIENCE I'm reminded of Michael Pollan's healthy living suggestion: ▶ Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Here's mine for resumes: ▶ Write stu $ . Not too much. Mostly highlights. Almost as catchy, right? Identify Your Highlights What are the top few things that would make a recruiter say, \"Yes, I want to interview you?\" Design your resume around those items such that, in a 30-second glance, a recruiter will notice them. Let’s say you’re fortunate enough to have FAANG experience or niche skills. How do you make sure that stands out to recruiters? Take a look at the before and after screenshots of this resume. 7 He actually has two of the three things that recruiters look for: FAANG experience and a niche title (ML engineer). But both are buried! And the section that gets the most attention is wasted on undergraduate awards. 7 We realize that recruiters won’t always have access to your resume when doing outreach and are likely looking at your LinkedIn instead. The same advice stands. Make sure that your About section has all the most important tidbits about you, front and center. Also, even though we didn’t see the same strong preference for FAANGs and underrepresented minority status when applying online (more on that in the next section), making these types of changes to your resume certainly won’t hurt. 48 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ER V I E W ▸ J O B SE AR CH E S, S TAR T TO FI N ISH View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co As you can see, he spent almost 3 years at Apple, but a recruiter skimming his resume might not notice that because it was a while ago. Instead, he showcases an undergrad award and some technologies/languages that he knows. Neither of those is nearly as useful to recruiters as FAANG experience. His current title is also ML engineer, and one at the Principal level at that. But it wasn’t always: He went from back-end to SRE to a little bit of everything to ML, and because of that, it’s possible a recruiter would miss it as well. We edited this candidate’s resume to put all the things recruiters look for at the very top of the resume and moved the buzzword soup to the bottom. This candidate is obviously well-positioned because he has FAANG CHAP T ER 6 ▸ R E SUM E S 49 experience, several top schools, and niche skills—but before, many recruiters didn’t spot them. After he made these changes, the number of interviews he got increased by 8X. Clear, Concise Bullets Bullets don’t matter that much, but you have to have something there, so you might as well take a few minutes to clean them up. Bullet points should be clear and concise, demonstrating what you worked on and its impact. For example: • Clear impact: Created and launched a service that collects product opinions and recommendations from Twitter. The service # nds related tweets, removes spam, analyzes sentiment and creates a struc - tured database of everything that was said about particular products. • Unclear impact: Designed software application including: data modeling, software architecture design, software-hardware integration, user interface design, and database management. Where possible, use metrics to back up the impact. Don't force it though; many accomplishments don't have associated metrics. Be careful that your bullets aren't too long, either. Bullets should be a mix of 1 - 2 lines. Giant blocks of text are very hard to understand. When you only have time (or only feel like spending the time) to skim, paragraphs are going to get skipped. Company/Team Summaries For each company where you worked, if it’s not a household name, write a 1 - 2 sentence summary of what the company did. If it is a household name, write a 1 - 2 sentence summary of what your team’s purpose was. If it's really obvious (e.g., front-end on Google Docs), you can skip it if you're short on space. This is mostly here to set context for your bullets. SKILLS, EDUCATION AND OTHER SECTIONS While you'll typically have a section for Skills and Education on your resume, there are no hard-and-fast rules for what sections you can and can't have. • Got some cool projects? Great! Go for it. That's pretty common, in fact. • Contribute to a lot of open source projects? Okay, you can have an \"open source\" section. • Won some relevant awards? Okie dokie. An awards section it is. The point is to make your awesomeness standout, quickly. Do what you need to do to make that happen. About Whether you have an About section is really up to you. It can be a useful way to showcase details that might otherwise be missed (e.g., FAANG+ experience that isn't recent), but this isn't something you need to include. Our recommendation is to not include it during your # rst draft, but then to put it in if your highlights are otherwise being missed. Education You're typically going to have an Education section on your resume. As a mediocre rule of thumb, current students or fresh grads will typically list education # rst, and professionals will list work experience # rst. This is convention, but it came to be for a very good reason: it showcases what is typically more relevant. Screw convention. If this isn't what's best for you, then do something di $ erent. • If, for example, you are currently attending a no-name university with an Economics degree but have some FAANG+ internships as a Software Engineer, then you probably are better o $ listing your work experience # rst.",

(That's probably a silly example 8 , right?) Yes, some people might initially misread your resume, but that's perhaps a risk worth taking. GPA You don't have to list your GPA on your resume and most people don't care a whole lot—or, at least, they say they don't. If you're a current student or new grad, the conventional wisdom is: • List your GPA if it's above a 3.0 • Skip it if it's below a 3.0 This is one of those cases where conventional wisdom is reasonable. Note that, because this is the conven- tional wisdom, recruiters will often make the assumption that \"no GPA\" implies \"low GPA.\" # Again, people don't care much about your GPA. However, your GPA typically gets listed on the same line as your degree, so it also doesn't take up additional space. If you have a good GPA and you've graduated recently, it doesn't hurt you to list it. If you have considerable experience, you probably want to just leave o $ your GPA. It just looks weird when someone has 20+ years of experience and still has their GPA on their resume. Skills It's standard to list what languages and technologies you know. But do you list everything you ever worked with? Just what you're comfortable being tested on right now ? What you could brush up on fairly quickly? What exactly does an interviewer assume by the listing of a speci # c language on your resume? I (Gayle) have asked this question to hundreds of interviewers over the years, and answers are all over the map. Some interviewers assume \"pro # ciency\" if a language is on a resume, and then others assume \"you worked with it at some point\"—and many others are in between. What this means for you is that whatever you do is wrong... or right. Here's our advice: • List languages in pro # ciency order • Drop a language if neither of the following is true: » You have worked with it (professionally or personally) in depth in the last three years » You could code a typical interview question with it, with only minor syntax errors • Focus on languages, not & avors of a language (particularly for top-tier companies and most startups). There is stigma 9 at many companies when candidates list every version of a language. If you aren't sure whether a language makes the cut, you can describe your pro # ciency. For example, you can say \"Skills: Python (pro # cient); Java (pro # cient); C++ (prior experience but now rusty). 8 https://www.linkedin.com/in/alinelerner/details/experience/ 9 When people ask why there is stigma, the answer usually goes something about companies hiring in a language agnostic way; if they are okay hiring a Java developer to write Python, then why would they care about which versions of Python you know? That's true, but doesn't address the stigma question. The answer to that is a bit unfair, but it is essentially that while top-tier companies are language agnostic, many lower-tier companies are not. And in fact, the lower-tier companies often do care about the speci # c & avors of a language. When you list the & avors of Java that you know, they bucket you as a developer who would work for a lower-tier company. It's not fair, but it's the truth. CHAP T ER 6 ▸ R E SUM E S 51 Projects If you don't have much work experience, or if you don't have experience in a relevant technology, projects can boost your relevant experience. You might as well show these o $ , if you have them. Don't list every project you've done though. Typically, you want to stick to at most three projects. After this, you are typically just # lling in less interesting or relevant projects. PROOFREAD Per a study I (Aline) did when I was head of talent at TrialPay 10 , one of the best predictors of who got an o $ er was the number of typos and grammatical errors: the best candidates had two or fewer mistakes. While non-coders often won't be surprised by this (isn't this the advice our moms and dads used to tell us?), it's often a surprise to coders—speci # cally, that this would apply to even an engineering resume. Why would people care so much about typos on an engineer's resume? Is this even fair, particularly given that, for many engineers, English is their second (or third or fourth!) language? We can argue all we want about whether this is \"fair,\" and it might even be merely correlation 11 not causation. Nonetheless, in case it is causal, you'd be advised to proofread. You don’t want your resume to look like this: Read it yourself, use the automated spelling/grammar check, send it to your favorite bot, and have a friend check it 12 . RELAX Let's end with a good (and by good, we mean terrible) story. It’s from an early employee at one of the FAANGs, which we'll call \"Company\" to protect the guilty. A long time ago, when Company was still small, we moved from our small downtown o % ce to a new o % ce in a local business park. Years later, I had a meeting in a conference room I'd never been to before. On my way to the room, I heard some beeps. I went searching for the source of the beeps, and in some small side room, in a deserted corner of the building, was a printer with a big stack of paper in the out tray. I looked at the papers, and they were all cover letters and resumes. I looked into it and found out that this printer was also a fax machine! It turned out that it was the fax number on Company's o % cial 10 https://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/ 11 Perhaps, engineers who proofread their resumes carefully are also more likely to check their code thoroughly. Or perhaps they were more passionate about that job and so they proofread their resume more. Or perhaps... a variety of other non-causal explanations. 12 I (Gayle) once received a resume where a candidate described that she was \"inept at Javascript.\" I presume she meant \"adept\" (skilled) and was not intending to reveal herself to be incompetent. 52 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ERV I E W ▸ J O B SE AR CH E S, S TAR T TO FI N ISH View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co jobs page! For years, the fax number mentioned on our jobs page went to a printer in some corner that nobody knew existed. Despite all of this—your resume not actually being the thing that gets you noticed, how little time recruit- ers spend reviewing your resume, how inconsistent reviewers are, how little you can actually do to drive change—we’ve seen candidates agonize over each bullet point, # nessing each and every word. But if the people reading your resume are barely skimming and can't agree on what they're looking for, it is incredibly di % cult to optimize. You need to get someone to consider you. That is done through personal outreach, not picking out your resume from the black hole that is an ATS (Applicant Tracking System). Make your resume good enough for when someone opens your email and is intrigued, but don't stress too much about it. Job searches are stressful enough. C H A P T E R 7 I C H A P T E R 7 I C H A P T E R 7 I I G E T T I N G I N T H E D O O R Material for this chapter at bctci.co/getting-in-the-door We recently surveyed interviewing.io users about which methods of getting in the door at companies worked well for them in their last job search. Here are the results. 1 Interestingly, these results were quite consistent between company types; channels that worked well for FAANGs tended to work well for startups and vice versa. E ff ective recruiting channels, ranked from most to least e ff ective: • Warm referrals (referrals from people who know you well and have worked with you in the past) • In-house recruiters contact you • Apply online • Cold outreach to hiring managers Ine ff ective recruiting channels: • Cold outreach to recruiters • Cold referrals (referrals from people who don’t know you) • Agency recruiters contact you Overall, the most useful channels were in-house recruiters (when they reached out to you) and warm referrals. Obviously, whether you know someone at a company you’re interested in and whether recruiters reach out to you are largely out of your control. So what can you control? Here are all of these channels, graphed with respect to both their e $ ectiveness and how much control you have over them. It turns out that cold outreach to hiring managers , when done right , is both e $ ective and controllable. In our experience, that channel is both misused and underutilized and is the best bet for many candidates (see \"What to Actually Do\" on page 59). Now let’s look at each channel in detail. 1 This data came primarily from surveying experienced engineers (4+ years), rather than juniors. 54 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ER V I E W ▸ J O B SE AR CH E S, S TAR T TO FI N ISH View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co Figure 1. Channels graphed with respect to both their e $ ectiveness and how much control you have over them. IN ' HOUSE RECRUITERS CONTACT YOU You have little control over this. The best thing you can do is to make sure that the things recruiters look for (pg 44) are well-highlighted on your resume (if it’s public-facing) and on your LinkedIn. The rest is luck. APPLY ONLINE If you’ve ever applied to jobs online, then you know it’s kind of like screaming into a black hole. 2 Though some candidates get value out of this channel, it’s still a numbers game. According to recruiting tool Gem, applicants who come from recruiter outreach (called “outbound” in recruiter lingo) are 6 - 10X more likely to get hired than applicants who apply online (called “inbound”). 3 As Lyft recruiting manager Nate Wylie put it: Our data... showed higher pass-through rates for candidates \\[we reached out to\\] at each stage of the interview process vs. applicants via the careers page. It’s not that we want to ignore applicants; it’s just that historically we don’t get what we’re looking for—and with speed—through that channel. 4 The silver lining here is that when you don’t hear back from a company (or even when you get an automatic rejection email wishing you \"the best in your future endeavors\"), it’s not because a human looked at your resume and made a deliberate, thoughtful decision about you. It’s tempting to think that way because it plays so well into our insecurities. The reality is that a human probably never saw your resume in the # rst place. 2 Or, like faxing your resume to an old machine buried in a closet that no one has entered in years. 3 https://www.gem.com/blog/outbound-candidates-more-likely-to-be-hired 4 Having been a recruiter myself, I (Aline) can con # rm that many companies do indeed ignore their online careers page. Many years ago, when I # rst joined the recruiting team at a top-tier startup, I spent my # rst few days going through the resumes of people who had applied online. I found a treasure trove of candidates, including very experienced applicants from top-tier companies. But no one had seen these applicants because no one had been monitoring inbound activity for months! CHAP T ER 7 ▸ G E T T I N G I N T H E D O O R 55 So why do people apply online, despite knowing in their gut that it’s not an e $ ective strategy? Simply put, it’s predictable and easy. You get into a routine, you upload your resume, you connect your LinkedIn, and you can knock out hundreds of applications in a matter of hours. # Applying online doesn’t hurt, as long as you don't get personally hurt over it. If you do, it’ll wear you down over time. WARM REFERRALS Warm referrals are, of course, excellent. That is, assuming it's a real referral—someone who can actually vouch for you, and ideally, your work. Per capita, referrals are most companies’ best source of candidates, and they were a great channel for our users across all company types. If you have the network, you should absolutely use it. Just keep in mind that most internal referral forms contain a question about how well you know this person and where this person ranks (top 5%, bottom 10%, etc.) in your estimation, compared to other people you’ve worked with. Just because someone refers you doesn’t mean they’ll be dishonest on this form, so take care to choose your referrers wisely. Even if you have a great history with someone, we know that asking for a referral can be awkward, so if you're struggling with # nding the right words, here are some handy snippets you can use, depending on the situation: bctci.co/outreach-what-to-say-1 Of course, it’s unlikely that you’ll have meaningful connections at every company you want to work at. What do you do then? COLD REFERRALS Should you ask people you don't know to refer you? Our survey data says probably not. While cold referrals once worked, 5 many companies nowadays separate referrals into \"true referrals\" and \"leads.\" It’s great for maintaining the delicate dance of social dynamics, but it’s useless for getting hired— dropping someone’s resume into the “leads” pile is like throwing it into the inbound black hole. Given that cold referrals aren’t zero e $ ort, our advice is to expend that energy elsewhere. More on that shortly. AGENCY RECRUITERS Agency recruiters were the worst channel overall, according to our survey, and were net negative for all company types. FAANGs and FAANG-adjacent companies tend to rely less on agencies than startups, and when they do, it’s to # ll some very speci # c need (rather than “Hey we need more SWEs”), so it’s not surprising that our users didn’t get much value from this channel when applying to FAANGs. 5 Years ago, trying to collect cold referrals was a decent strategy. You could track down someone at the company and ask them to toss your proverbial hat into the ring. Engineers were often happy to refer someone — even someone they didn't know — either to be kind, to avoid the awkwardness of declining, or to collect the potential referral bonus. They couldn't vouch for you, but the referral would ensure that a human looked at your resume. This became so common that Blind spun out an entire referral marketplace where applicants would pay a small sum for a referral. Then, companies wised up and realized that these referrals weren't all that di $ erent from normal inbound applicants. So why treat them di $ erently? 56 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ERV I E W ▸ J O B SE AR CH E S, S TAR T TO FI N ISH View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co While both large and small startups use agencies liberally, clearly the value to candidates is limited. 6 Out of all of our survey respondents, only a handful of our users said that agencies were useful to them, and of those who mentioned agencies, the majority said that they were the worst channel. We won’t belabor the point, but it’s probably not in your best interest to spend much time working with agency recruiters. It has an opportunity cost and not much upside. And you can routinely get screwed in salary negotiations when you work with an agency recruiter pg 29, if you even get that far. COLD OUTREACH Not all cold outreach is created equal, for two reasons. First, there’s your audience: hiring managers vs. recruiters. And then there’s the quality of the outreach itself. We'll talk more about how to write the kinds of messages that will get you responses in (pg 61), but # rst, let’s talk about the audience. You can see in our survey results that cold outreach to hiring managers was net positive for FAANG/FAANG- adjacent companies and neutral for the other company types. Cold outreach to recruiters, on the other hand, was net negative for both FAANG/FAANG-adjacents and small startups and neutral for large startups. Ignoring the quality of the outreach for a moment, which we expect is probably comparable for both types, why does this di $ erence exist? If you had to answer the question of who’s the right person to reach out to about jobs, your gut instinct might be to say it’s recruiters. After all, hiring good people is o % cially their job! But what does “good” really mean? COLD OUTREACH TO RECRUITERS DOESN’T WORK When I ran my own recruiting agency, I kept running into the same wall. I’d present candidates who didn’t look good on paper but who I had strong reason to believe were actually good. Recruiters at my client companies, by and large, would not entertain those candidates because it was simply too risky for them . Engi- neering time is precious, and if a recruiter presents a candidate who doesn’t # t the mold and that candidate ultimately doesn’t work out, it’s a strike against the recruiter. On the other hand, if a recruiter continually presents “safe”, name-brand candidates, some of whom make it through and some of whom do not, no one can blame you. It’s the whole adage about how no one ever got # red for choosing IBM, except with people. To put it really concretely, I’d expect that as an in-house recruiter, if you presented 10 name-brand candidates, 8 of whom didn’t get an o $ er, 1 of whom did but was clearly never interested in your company, and 0 of whom got hired, no one would bat an eye. On the other hand, if you presented 10 candidates, all of whom looked kind of weird on paper, 2 of whom got o $ ers, and 1 of whom got hired, you’d probably get a stern talking to. 7 You might think that, over time, companies would start to track which recruiters bring in candidates who actually get hired and reward those recruiters. The reality is that most recruiters aren’t evaluated this way because it takes too long. 6 We’d argue that the value to companies is limited as well. Though there are a handful of excellent agency recruiters out there, most are terrible. The hard thing is that, as an employer, you can’t immediately tell who’s terrible, and you end up wasting a bunch of time reviewing pro # les of candidates who might look promising on the surface, but because of selection bias (these are the people who decided to work with bad agency recruiters, after all) are not a # t. That or they’re not interested in your company (and have possibly never even opted in to talk to you) or both. 7 One of the # rst companies I worked with when I was running my own agency made a deal with me after seeing the non-traditional kinds of candidates I presented. They said that, though they’d be down to talk to the # rst 3 candidates I sent their way, if most of them didn’t make it to at least onsite, I was going to be # red. Not only did they work with me for a long time, this company later became one of interviewing.io’s # rst customers. CHAP T ER 7 ▸ G E T T I N G I N T H E D O O R 57 In theory, recruiters can be evaluated on what portion of their candidates get o $ ers or get to onsite. However, because of candidate drop-o $ and latency (getting an o $ er can still take months), your organization has to be pretty good at tracking metrics. Many are not. As such, many recruiting teams prefer simpler, faster metrics: Of the candidates you reached out to, how many responded? Of those who responded, how many resulted in a # rst conversation? The downside of measuring success in a single part of the funnel is that you don’t incentivize people to care about what happens downstream (that is, how many are hired). This would be like if marketers only paid attention to ad clicks, rather than actual purchases (although that’s often how it works with marketers, too). So, if you are typically just measuring the response rates of your reports, you have to set some guardrails and proxies for the types of candidates that you want your team to reach out to. If you don’t, they’ll end up just reaching out to people who are likely to respond instead of people who are a good # t for the job. That brings us back to the idea of a “name-brand” candidate that we discussed earlier. So what does a name-brand candidate look like? You can’t just go on LinkedIn, and say, “Find me good engineers.” 8 That doesn’t exist. So instead, you come up with some proxies that look like this: • Senior engineers. Why seniors? Juniors are generally easier to hire, so companies don’t need to go beyond what they usually do to # ll those roles. For college students, specifically, there’s a separate university department that deals with college hires once a year in September. • Went to a top school • Worked at a top company There may be a few other items on the list if the role requires speci # c skills (e.g., Android development), but by and large, that’s what recruiters are tasked with, and that’s what they’re focused on. # What does this mean for you? If you’re not the type of candidate that recruiters are reaching out to already (senior, well-pedigreed), they will not help you. 8 People think that because recruiters are, generally speaking, not technical, they can’t identify talent. In fairness, hiring managers aren’t very good at identifying talent based on resumes either. When I tested engineers vs. engineering managers vs. recruiters at this task, I learned everyone is bad at it: https://blog.alinelerner.com/resumes-suck-heres- the-data/ 58 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ERV I E W ▸ J O B SE AR CH E S, S TAR T TO FI N ISH View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co With that sad reality in mind, here’s the good news: there is someone who’s actually incentivized to make hires and is much more open-minded: the hiring manager! 9 REACH OUT TO HIRING MANAGERS INSTEAD Unlike recruiters, hiring managers are judged on how quickly and e $ ectively they’re able to build stu $ , and are—directly or indirectly—incentivized to grow headcount. 10 For hiring managers, it’s not about the appear- ance of doing the work; it’s about the cold, hard reality of whether the work got done. And because they’re judged on actually getting stu $ done, hiring managers are also much more incentivized than recruiters to take risks. Outside of needing more people to build things, hiring managers are also incentivized to hire for their teams because the better they are at recruiting and # lling headcount, the more likely they are to get promoted. So, armed with an understanding of how hiring works behind the scenes, here’s our recommended, hyper- practical approach. It starts with treating your job like a sales funnel. TREAT YOUR JOB SEARCH LIKE A SALES FUNNEL If you’re an engineer, chances are you haven’t ever done sales. 11 But if you do sales for any appreciable amount of time, you’ll start thinking about everything in life as a funnel. Funnels are wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. That’s why they’re such an apt metaphor for the sales process—you do a lot of outreach, and you don’t get many responses. Of the responses you do get, relatively few will do the thing you want them to do. And even fewer will ultimately “close” (aka, buying—or, in this case, hiring). In your engineering career, you’ve mastered many abstract concepts that are much more complex than a funnel. Despite its simplicity, however, the funnel is one of the hardest concepts to internalize emotionally, especially for people who are used to having control over outcomes. When you write code for n hours, you can expect that you will build m features . In sales though, you do a lot of work, very little of it will pan out, and when it does pan out, it can feel almost random; an impersonal, mediocre email gets a response while your beautifully targeted email is met with deafening silence. And then there’s rejection. When you apply to jobs online and don’t hear back, it stings, but the sting is softened by the possibility that a human never even saw your application. You’re not reaching out to people when you apply online; you’re dealing with a bureaucratic machine. 9 Note that if you’re interested in smaller startups (Series A and below), you can substitute “founder” for “hiring manager” in these steps. Founders are the most incentivized to get shit done and take risks, regardless of company size and stage, but at larger startups, they may be less likely to read cold emails because they get bombarded with all manners of requests and sales pitches. At a Series B or C company or at public companies with fewer than, say, 3000 employees, in addition to hiring managers, you should also target Directors and VPs — they have the power to get things done and aren’t so far removed from feeling the pain of not # lling roles that making an extra hire or two is out of their purview. At large public companies, targeting Directors and above doesn’t make much sense — they ARE too far removed from doing the work to make individual hires. If you do contact them, the best outcome is that they’ll pass you on to one of their direct reports. 10 Yes, hiring managers are actually sometimes evaluated on their ability to hire. Moreover, the more headcount a manager is able to command, the greater their political capital inside the organization, and the easier it is to not only get promoted but also get hired at their next company for increasingly senior titles. 11 Maybe you had a job in high school selling Cutco knives or magazines, in which case what we’re about to say will resonate. CHAP T ER 7 ▸ G E T T I N G I N T H E D O O R 59 On the other hand, when you email a real human and they don’t respond, that hurts: you put yourself out there, someone made a value judgment about you, and you lost. The good news is that, after a while, the pain lessens, and you build up some useful emotional calluses and acquire the thousand-yard stare of someone who’s been rejected a million times for a million reasons, ranging from soul-crushingly legitimate to incontrovertibly random. Sadly, there’s no shortcut. You’ve got to do the reps, you’ve got to get the rejections, and you’ve got to pick yourself up again. You get used to it, and then it doesn’t hurt as much, because experience has taught you that if you keep going, you will eventually get to a yes. PREREQUISITES/TOOLING • Buy a month or two of LinkedIn Sales Navigator. This will run you a few hundred dollars, but it’s worth it. • Get an account with an email discovery tool like RocketReach. • Get Streak, which lets you do mail merges in Gmail. You create an email template, with variables for everything from recipient name to long snippets of personalized text, and then you upload a CSV with all the values. The resulting emails feel personalized but get sent to hundreds of people at once. WHAT TO ACTUALLY DO Figure out which companies you’re interested in First, make a list of the companies where you want to work. This sounds easy, but it’s not necessarily. Many people will just write down a few FAANGs and whatever companies are hot right now and call it a day. That’s not necessarily a bad strategy. Having a top-tier brand on your resume can legitimize you for future job searches, and they tend to pay well too. But we recommend you look beyond the obvious to other companies whose work might excite you: • Are there any dev tools that you really admire? • Are there any open-source projects you follow? • Are there any engineers you follow on social media whose work you admire? • Look at where your friends work by combing through Facebook or LinkedIn or both. Reach out to them to ask what it’s like (before you even ask for a referral). If you’re not sure how to ask people about the day-to-day, we’ve included a template for you in the Referrals section: bctci.co/outreach-what-to-say-1 Here are some resources to help you # nd companies you might be interested in: Y Combinator’s Work at a Startup, Wellfound, Remote Rocketship, levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and Blind. Get links and more details at: bctci.co/resources-to- # nd-companies Make your target list Once you have your list of companies, use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to # nd hiring managers at those compa- nies (or founders or directors or VPs, as above). If the list is large, consider # lters for: 60 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ER V I E W ▸ J O B SE AR CH E S, S TAR T TO FI N ISH View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co • Just targeting managers , not Directors or VPs. Google is a huge organization. You want the people who are most likely to help, and they’re the ones who are struggling to hire for their teams. • In position for less than 2 years: These are the people who are still trying to prove themselves and who are less likely to have a long-standing relationship with their recruiter to the point where they only rely on internal recruiting and overlook other sources of candidates. • Geography: Let's focus on the places we most want to work. • 1st- or 2nd-degree connection: This way, when they look you up, they’ll see some social proof. You can expand this to 3rd-degree connections if needed. Once you have your list, put their LinkedIn URLs into a spreadsheet. Then, do a pass through your targets’ pro # les and see if any of them link to personal websites, social media accounts, blogs, or anything else that will help you # nd common ground with them. Add any useful links in your spreadsheet because we’ll be mining them when we actually write our emails. If you come from a non-traditional background (e.g., you didn’t attend a top school or work at a prestigious company), consider adding startups to your target list, if you’re at all open to working at a startup. Then try to # nd startups who have a founder from a non-traditional background like you—you’d be surprised by how many founders don’t have a traditional pedigree (many end up taking the founder road because they get tired of being overlooked). If you can # nd people like you, it’ll be easier to establish common ground, and you’ll be more likely to get a response. Look up their email addresses Once you have your list of LinkedIn URLs, use a tool like RocketReach to look up their emails. RocketReach is a nice tool for email discovery because 1) it takes LinkedIn URLs as inputs and 2) its email database is generally up-to-date and correct. CHAP T ER 7 ▸ G E T T I N G I N T H E D O O R 61 Why not reach out on LinkedIn? While recruiters live on LinkedIn, managers generally do not. They may not even like or check LinkedIn much. They live in their email, so that's where you want to target them. If RocketReach fails or you don't wish to pay for it, you might just be able to guess their email address, as email addresses tend to follow common forms: # rstname@company.com, # rstinitial.lastname@company. com, or # rstname.lastname@company.com. Where possible, contact managers via their work email address. 12 It’s okay to fall back to their personal email if you can’t # gure out the work one, though. Outreach emails are not a job application Before we tell you how to write outreach emails, it’s important to understand that they are di $ erent from a job application. • You’re connecting with a human being, not an Applicant Tracking System. Your goal is to make them think you’re worth talking to. If you were at a party, you wouldn’t come up to a person and immediately start listing frameworks and languages that you know, so don’t do that here. • Not super focused on a speci $ c position or team. Job descriptions are written badly, many open roles aren’t listed, and you will never have enough information to make this decision. Be ok with that, and just focus on getting in the door somehow. This means that when you come up with your target list, you don’t have to # nd exactly the right hiring manager. All you need to do is get in the door with someone, and then they’ll route you to someone else. This email isn’t the be-all and end-all of your job search. It won’t get you a job. It will just get you in the door. It doesn’t need to be perfect. You just need to get to the next step. Write succinct, highly personalized emails Now that you have your target list, it’s time to compose a fairly personalized, yet short, email. All too often, candidates write a long, generic cover letter that’s clearly been sent to a ton of people. I get many emails that look like this (in these emails, we left in typos if there were any to begin with): Hello Aline, By way of linkedin search connections, I found through your contact information. I am a Engineering management professional with 16+ years of engineering experience currently on the lookout for a suitable job in Bay Area.

Regards, REDACTED ▶ Don’t do this either! There is nothing here about why this candidate is a good # t for interviewing.io, and the bullets aren’t compelling enough on their own. Emails like the above are impersonal and tell me that you didn't really invest time in understanding me and my company . If you didn't invest in me, why should I invest in you? • Don't open the email with how they found you. We really don't care, and you want the # rst line to be meaningful. • Don't be overly formal in how you address the person. Use their $ rst name. 13 • Don't get their gender wrong (e.g., referring to a woman as \"sir\"); you’d be surprised how often this happens). • Don't paste in a generic cover letter. These are sure to get ignored—if you’re not going to put in the e $ ort to write to me personally, why would I put in the e $ ort to read your email? 13 In some cultures, using your target’s # rst name might come o $ as overly informal. Use your best judgment here if outside the U.S. CHAP T ER 7 ▸ G E T T I N G I N T H E D O O R 63 • Don’t lead with “buzzword soup”. You’re talking to a human and trying to build rapport with them, not subverting an Applicant Tracking System. • Don't forget to include a link to a LinkedIn or a personal website. We don’t recommend attaching your resume, though. It can seem overly formal/somewhat presumptuous if you're trying to build rapport. 14 More broadly, if you want someone to go out on a limb for you, make it dead simple for them to justify expending their social/political capital on you. Hiring managers, as a rule, want to help. Make it a no-brainer for them. There are three components to a great cold email: 1. Common ground with your target: Not every cold email will have common ground; there’s simply not enough information out there about some targets to be able to craft a compelling narrative that’s highly personalized to them. 2. Proof that you’re worthy of their time: It is your job to sell yourself quickly and succinctly. You want your target to feel like they’d be an idiot to pass up the chance to talk to you. 3. A strong call to action: Ask for a meeting or something else. Let's dive into these in more detail. Finding common ground The email below is personal, succinct, and # nds common ground. Not only that, but it conveniently # nds common ground that bene \" ts the candidate (a soft-spot for non-traditional candidates, like themselves!). Aline, I've been reading your blog over the past 6 months and I seriously appreciate your pragmatic, no-nonsense approach to technical recruiting. In your recent article about building technical recruit- ing products, you included a footnote about non-traditional candidates that really resonated with me. I consider myself one of those non-traditional candidates—not always the obvious # t on paper, but I kick ass once I'm in an interview. I would love to work with you if there is an opportunity to do so. If not, perhaps in the future. In either case, thank you for taking a few minutes to read this email and best of luck with interviewing.io. Thanks, REDACTED To # nd common ground, reference something your target cares about . Then either show them that you care about it too or that helping you would # t into their worldview and further that cause. Here are some examples of great ways to build common ground: • Reference a project they worked on (maybe they wrote a blog post about it, mentioned it in a comment on Hacker News, or are a contributor to some open-source project). Then, either talk about relevant work you've done (if there is a genuine connection) or alternatively ask a thoughtful question or two about theirs. • Reference a controversial 15 point of view that they hold, and a % rm it in an authentic way. 14 If you don’t have a LinkedIn or a personal site, then a resume may be better than nothing. But also, creating a LinkedIn pro # le is free, so if you don't have a LinkedIn pro # le, go make one. 15 We mean something like \"spaces are better than tabs\", not something erring into viewpoints that could be o $ ensive or discriminatory. 6 4 B E YO N D CR ACK I N G T H E CO D I N G I N T ERV I E W ▸ J O B SE AR CH E S, S TAR T TO FI N ISH View online materials for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview at bctci.co • In the absence of something technical, it’s okay to reference something non-technical you've seen on their public pro # les. We've seen candidates connect with strangers based on a shared love of Star Wars or Hearthstone. We understand that you won't always be able to # nd common ground. But if you can, it'll help you a lot, especially if you’re light on social proof or accomplishments. Selling yourself Selling yourself is usually about one of two things: • Accomplishments: What have you built or created? • Social proof: Have you worked at a top company or attended a top school? Some people are fortunate enough to have both, but many will have just one. That’s okay. We’ll work with what you have! Accomplishments should answer the following questions. What have you done that most other people haven’t? What have you done that, if you were to tell it to a stranger, would cause them to pause and think you're special or interesting? Below are some examples: • A blog post you wrote about a technical topic did well 16 on Hacker News, Reddit, or social media. • Something you built got some great press when your company announced its last funding round. • You refactored a piece of code at work, and now it runs 100X faster. • You won a company hackathon. • You’re a core contributor to a notable open-source project. • Something you built is being used by a number of other people. Remember, even if you're a new engineer in the # eld, and you don't have job experience yet, you still have accomplishments you can highlight! Social proof is about your pedigree—attending a top school, working at a company known for having a high engineering bar, etc. People won't click on links or open your resume until after they're interested, so you need to get them interested right away. That is: you should spoon-feed them the most impressive-sounding things about you out of the gate. This may feel strange and uncomfortable like you’re bragging. However, we assure you that it’s necessary to get your target’s attention. They’re not thinking you’re bragging. They’re thinking, “Is this worth my time?” Your job is to convince them that it is. Also, don’t forget to link to your LinkedIn or personal website. Attaching a resume may feel too heavy-handed for a # rst conversation, as we discussed earlier (pg 63). Here's an example of a prospective intern, leveraging both social proof and accomplishments, to write a compelling email. Hello Ms. Lerner, My name is REDACTED, and I am a sophomore at MIT. I wanted to reach out directly to you, as I am looking for a possible opportunity to sharpen my technical skills over this REDACTED and truly love Interviewing.io’s mission in reimagining the art of engineering recruitment! I have extensive experience in software development, having interned at IBM, MIT CSAIL (being featured by Redacted Newspaper 1 and Redacted Newspaper 2), and REDACTED previously (resumes attached 16 Many people think that for something to be worth mentioning, it has to have gone viral. That’s simply not correct – in our niche space, a few hundred likes or a few thousand upvotes is already really impressive.",
