It’s a classic, and the main point is that good design should make everything painfully obvious to users without demanding anything of them. Resumes are just the same. Your resume shouldn’t make recruiters think. It should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less. Before I share some resume tips, there’s something important I want to reiterate: Don’t spend a lot of time on your resume. You can read my piece about how resume writing is snake oil, but the TL;DR is that recruiters spend a median of 30 seconds looking at resumes, and most of that is spent looking for top-tier companies. If you don’t have top-tier companies (and in some cases niche skills), wordsmithing your bullets or rearranging your sections or changing your layout won’t help. If you do have top-tier companies, sometimes doing some wordsmithing and rearrangement will help… if your top company experience or niche skills are buried. If you don’t have top-tier brands, the best bang for your buck is to switch from online applications to hiring manager outreach. Here’s how to do it. With that said, I know that no matter what I say, people will still grind on their resumes instead of doing outreach. Grinding on resumes is safe. Outreach is scary and opens you up to personal (rather than impersonal) rejection. So, look, if you’re going to do something to your resume, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Unlike the endless resume tweaking that most candidates do, these changes directly address how recruiters actually read resumes. Here we go. Stop putting filler buzzwords in your \"About\" section. Use it to spell out the most impressive things about you. Your \"About\" or \"Summary\" section is prime real estate. Yet so many candidates fill this section with meaningless jargon like \"passionate self-starter\" or \"detail-oriented team player.\" Instead, use this section to explicitly tell recruiters the 2-3 most impressive things about you in plain English. This is your chance to control the narrative. Want recruiters to take something away from reading your resume? Don’t assume they’ll figure it out. They’re not reading it long enough to intuit anything. Spell it out for them verbatim in this section. Do this, not that: ❌ Results-driven full-stack engineer with a passion for scalable systems and user-centric design ✅ Senior engineer with 3 years at Amazon, promoted twice in 3 years (2X the company average)1 Don’t include your GPA if it’s under 3.8 This is simple but effective: only include your GPA if it's 3.8 or higher2. A middling GPA doesn't help your case and might inadvertently signal academic mediocrity. If your GPA isn't stellar, focus on other academic achievements: hackathons, technical competitions, fellowships or scholarships. These provide better signals about your capabilities than a so-so GPA. Context matters for lesser-known companies If you've worked at Google or Facebook, recruiters instantly get what kind of company you're coming from. But when you have \"TechStartup123\" on your resume, they have no idea what they're looking at or how impressive it might be. For lesser-known companies, include a one-line description explaining what the company does, along with any impressive metrics or investors: ❌ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc.\" ✅ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc. ($50M Series B from Sequoia, 2M+ active users)\" This simple addition provides crucial context that helps recruiters evaluate your experience properly. Without it, they might discount valuable experience simply because they don't recognize the company name. Avoid the \"job-hopper\" misperception Here's a common mistake: listing each role at the same company as if they were separate jobs. This can make recruiters think you've job-hopped, which is often seen as a red flag. Instead, group different roles under the same company heading: ❌ Listing separate entries for \"Junior Developer at XYZ\" and \"Senior Developer at XYZ\" ✅ \"XYZ Company - Senior Developer (2021-Present) - Junior Developer (2019-2021) Promoted in 2 years vs. company average of 3.5 years\" The second format clearly shows growth within a single company and explicitly highlights faster-than-average promotion, which is a strong positive signal. (You may also want to carry over your promotion cadence into your “About” section, as you saw above.) Be crystal clear about your work authorization status This one is particularly crucial if you have a foreign-sounding name and/or education outside the US. I've seen many qualified candidates get passed over because recruiters assumed they needed visa sponsorship when they actually didn't. Don't leave this to chance. Make your work status explicit in your header or summary section: ❌ No mention of work authorization (leaving recruiters to guess) ✅ \"US Citizen\" or \"Green Card Holder\" or \"Authorized to work in the US without visa sponsorship\" Career changers: provide context about the change If you've switched careers, your resume can look confusing without proper context. Recruiters might struggle to understand why someone with your background is applying for this role, or they might not recognize how your previous experience translates to your current trajectory. Address this head-on in your “About” section. ❌ Listing previous career experience with no explanation of your transition ✅ \"Transitioned from marketing to software engineering in 2021 after completing a bootcamp\" or \"Former accountant who pivoted to data science through self-study and online courses while continuing full-time work\" This context helps recruiters understand your timeline and puts your current title and achievements in perspective. Without it, you risk serious misinterpretation: Recruiters might think you're far more junior than you actually are in your new field (potentially ruling you out for appropriate-level positions) Or conversely, they might assume you have years of relevant experience in your new field (and then wonder why you haven't achieved more in that time) Both misinterpretations can be fatal to your application. By providing a clear timeline of your transition, you help recruiters accurately gauge your experience level and set appropriate expectations. This transparency also demonstrates valuable traits like adaptability and determination. And here's another key point for career changers: you don't need to list all your previous positions before the transition... unless they're impressive. Be selective about what pre-transition experience you include: ❌ DON'T include mundane or irrelevant details from your previous career that add nothing to your current narrative. Your three years as a retail associate before becoming a developer probably won't strengthen your software engineering application. ✅ DO highlight prestigious achievements from your previous career. If you were, say, a concert pianist, a lawyer who graduated from a top-tier law school, or a management consultant at McKinsey, absolutely include that. These signal that you're smart and high-achieving, regardless of domain. In conclusion If you do all these things, you may or may not see a return. After all, even the impact of these tweaks pales in comparison to having top brands on your resume. But, given that these will take you a few minutes to do, it doesn’t hurt.

Read 9 chapters for free →interviewing.ioOpen menuInterview resourcesFor employersGift mock interviewsBlogFAQLog inGive it a tryBlog HomeWhy resume writing is snake oilBy Aline Lerner | Published: April 2, 2025I just asked ChatGPT to size the global resume writing industry. Here’s what it had to say: The global resume writing industry was valued at approximately $1.37 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow steadily, reaching around $1.44 billion by 2025, and about $1.59 billion by 2033... The growth is driven by increased demand for professional resume services due to heightened job market competition, coupled with advancements in technology and personalization through AI-driven resume writing tools. I don’t know if these numbers are exactly true, and I don't know what portion of that is resume writing for engineers specifically, but it doesn’t really matter. I am certain that they are directionally correct. As the market has gotten worse, I’ve heard more and more job seekers ask for resume reviews and rewrites, and I’ve seen many companies in the interview prep space start offering resume reviews. They’re all selling snake oil, and no one should spend a dime on it. I’ll explain why in a little bit, but first let’s talk about something else I found on the internet. A few days ago, I saw this post on Reddit. It was a leaked internal set of hiring requirements (sometimes called a “hiring spec”) that looked like this: Of course, there was the usual Reddit shock and awe and pearl clutching about whether this hiring spec could be real. Yes, it’s real. As someone who’s been in hiring for over a decade, I’m certain of it. And not only is it real, but it’s routine. It’s business as usual. I’ve been a head of talent at top startups, and I used to run my own recruiting agency where I hired for a bunch of companies who have since become household names. When I worked as an agency recruiter 10 years ago, companies regularly shared documents like this one with me. The only difference between then and now is the idea of a “diversity bonus.” Everything else hasn’t changed in a decade. Documents like this are why I quit recruiting to start interviewing.io. And documents like this are the reason that the entirety of the resume writing profession is a snake oil pit. There is one notable exception to this rule, which I’ll talk about, but most people should not spend a dime on resume writers. Here’s why. Recruiters aren’t reading your resume. They’re skimming it for very specific things. In 2024, we ran a study where we asked 76 recruiters to look at resumes and indicate which candidates they’d want to interview. Recruiters are most likely to contact you if: You look good on paper (i.e., you have top-tier companies and/or schools on your resume… just like in the “hiring spec” above) You belong to a group that’s been traditionally underrepresented in tech (i.e., you’re a woman or a person of color… just like in the “hiring spec” above) To some extent, if you have niche skills (e.g., ML engineering) What's missing? Things like, for example, having a quantifiable impact or demonstrating teamwork. Essentially, everything recruiters look for is stuff that you either have or you don't. In this same study, we also learned that when recruiters do look at resumes, they spend an average of 30 seconds reviewing them. That's not enough time to read every bullet. Instead, they are mainly skimming for recognizable companies and schools. Here is an excellent example, also from Reddit, that makes this difference very clear. This resume certainly passes the skim-test: good companies, appropriate roles, and a good university too. It's only when you actually spend more than 30 seconds reading the resume that you learn that not only is this resume obviously fake, but it also celebrates accomplishments like \"Spread Herpes STD to 60% of intern team.” And yet, it got a 90% callback rate. Recruiters just aren't reading the details. In other words, either you already have what recruiters are looking for (which often may be different than what’s explicitly listed in a job description… because they certainly aren’t sharing the real “hiring spec”) or you don’t. If you have it, then you don’t need a resume writer — though it’s always smart to make it easier for recruiters to find the things they’re looking for. If you don’t have what they’re looking for, no amount of agonizing over how you present yourself is going to move the needle. So, if recruiters aren’t reading and are just skimming for brands, why do people agonize over their resumes and give money to resume writers? Why the resume myth persists In interviewing.io’s Discord server, I regularly see requests for resume reviews. I also see other interview prep companies charging money for resume reviews. Presumably they charge because the demand is there. But why are people willing to pay for something that is completely useless? I think it’s a mix of misinformation and the desire for control. Recruiters rarely admit that they’re skimming primarily for brands. If you read recruiters’ advice for job seekers, it almost always includes advice about quantifying your impact, including your side projects1, and so on. These bits of advice are well-intentioned, I’m sure, but they perpetuate a harmful myth and an exploitative resume writing cottage industry. The other reason is control. Job searches are intimidating, and putting yourself out there is hard. It’s much easier to retreat to the comfort of polishing up your bullet points because it’s something you can control. You get into a routine, rewrite your bullets, and upload your resume to a bunch of places. Then when you don’t hear back, you retreat to familiar ground, grind on your bullets some more, and rinse and repeat. Because it’s easier to believe that if you can just get your bullets right, you’ll finally hear back. That narrative sure beats out the idea that no one is reading your resume no matter how much you fine-tune it. The notable exception: If you already look good on paper, polishing your resume CAN be useful. If you’re fortunate enough to have top brands on your resume, cleaning it up can be a good use of your time. I still wouldn’t hire a resume writer because the details don’t matter very much. Just make sure that recruiters can easily spot the brands. Here’s an example. Take a look at the before and after screenshots of the resume below. Before This resume belongs to one of our users who was kind enough to let us share it. He actually has two of the three things that recruiters look for: FAANG experience and a niche title (ML engineer). But both are buried! And the section that gets the most attention is wasted on undergraduate awards. As you can see, he spent almost 3 years at Apple, but a recruiter skimming his resume might not notice that because it was a while ago. Instead, he showcases an undergrad award and some technologies/languages that he knows. Neither of those is nearly as useful to recruiters as FAANG experience. His current title is also ML engineer, and one at the Principal level at that. But it wasn’t always: He went from back-end to SRE to a little bit of everything to ML, and because of that, it’s possible a recruiter would miss it as well. After We edited this candidate’s resume to put all the things recruiters look for at the very top of the resume and moved the buzzword soup to the bottom. This candidate is obviously well-positioned because he has FAANG experience, several top schools, and niche skills — but before, many recruiters didn’t spot them. After he made these changes, the number of interviews he got increased by 8X. Note that we didn’t really rewrite anything. We just moved stuff around. You can do this yourself without needing a professional writer. For everyone else, stop working on your resume, and start doing outreach. If you’re like most people, you don’t have top brands on their resume, so no amount of rewriting is going to move the needle much. Instead of agonizing over it, stop applying and start doing outreach to hiring managers. It’s your best shot to get noticed and to get someone to look at you as a human being, instead of a collection of brands. Here’s how to do it. For a deeper dive into both resume writing and how to get in the door, you can read Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview (both chapters are also available for free). Footnotes: Footnotes Will side projects help you get a job? Good question and one that should be teased apart a bit. Getting a job has two components: getting in the door and doing well in interviews. In general, side projects are useless for getting in the door. Yes, every once in a while, a side project goes viral. Or if you build something really cool with your target company’s API, it can get some attention. But that’s pretty rare. Most side projects that adorn resumes go completely unnoticed. When it comes to performing well in interviews, it depends. If the companies you’re interviewing at test you on practical skills, then they can be a great use of time. They can also be a great use of time to help you understand how APIs work, how the internet works, how clients and servers talk to each other, and so on. But if the companies you’re targeting primarily ask algorithmic questions, then side projects probably aren’t the best use of time. Finally, will side projects make you a better engineer? Absolutely. And that’s the best reason to do them. But that’s not quite the same as getting a job, is it? Once you're actively looking for a job, your time is better spent on interview prep and outreach. ↩ Life is chaos and pain.

I’ve found myself repeating that it’s OK to postpone interviews so often that I finally broke down and decided to make it a blog post. It’s very simple advice, so the bulk of this post will be spent trying to convince you that it’s fine to postpone. And then of course I’ll tell you what to say. Do any of these situations sound familiar? A recruiter from a FAANG (or other top-tier) company contacts you out of the blue and invites you to interview. You do the recruiter call, and it goes well. The recruiter reaches out to schedule your technical phone screen. You haven’t practiced enough, and you know it, but you are scared to tell the recruiter that you want to postpone the interview by a few months (months?!) because the position may no longer be there. So, you plow ahead, do the phone screen, fail it, and then you’re frozen out for a year. You were able to postpone your technical phone screen and take the time to study up on data structures & algorithms problems. You do well in the interview. But then your recruiter schedules your onsite the following week. Because you were so focused on DS&A prep, you haven’t had much time to study up on system design. You fumble the system design interview during the onsite, and you either get rejected or get down-leveled. Both of these situations are extremely common, but they’re both preventable. You can just ask to postpone. There are a few edge cases where that’s not a good idea, but in most situations, it’s the right thing to do. When postponing is OK, and when you shouldn’t take our advice If you’re applying to a large company with a centralized process (in other words, a process where you interview first and get matched with a team later), postponing is almost always OK. These companies are perpetually hiring, and their open roles are evergreen.1 Even if you’re applying to a large company with a decentralized process (where you interview for a specific team), we recommend postponing unless you’re extremely excited about the team you’re talking to. In that scenario, it’s possible that if you postpone, the slot will be filled. But if it’s not a perfect fit and you’d be OK with another team, we recommend postponing — in the worst case, you’ll simply get slotted into a different team. The only time when postponing isn’t a good idea is when you’re applying to a very small company that has just one open headcount. In that scenario, it is possible that postponing will cost you the opportunity because they’ll choose another candidate. However, you can ask how likely that is to happen, up front. With that edge case out of the way, here’s a little-known fact about how timing works at large companies: Recruiters don’t really care when you interview. Though they’d prefer that you interview sooner rather than later so they can hit their numbers, at the end of the day, they’d rather be responsible for successful candidates than unsuccessful ones. Every recruiter, in every job search, will tell you that time is of the essence because of all the other candidates in the pipeline. Most of the time, that is irrelevant and just something they say to create an artificial sense of urgency. There are always other candidates in the pipeline because the roles are evergreen. But they have nothing to do with your prospects. Exactly what to say to postpone your interviews You can use this text verbatim when postponing your interviews, and, with some small edits, you can even use it several times (e.g., before the phone screen and then again before the onsite). I’m really excited about interviewing at \\[company name\\]. Unfortunately, if I’m honest, I haven’t had a chance to practice as much as I’d like. I know how hard and competitive these interviews are, and I want to put my best foot forward. I think I’ll realistically need a couple of months to prepare. How about we schedule my interview for \\[date\\]? One important thing to remember is to be conservative about how long it will take. You’ve probably heard the adage about how, when you have to estimate the time an engineering task will take, you should think of a number and double it. Here, you may even want to triple it. I’ve seen many candidates ask for 2 weeks because that feels like a reasonable thing to ask for, only to have it blow up in their face when they realize they need to ask for another extension (which is still worth doing but harder because the company may think you’re taking them for a ride). If you need two months, ask for two months. Postponing can also be a good way to control the timing of your job search This section is extra credit, but once you get comfortable with postponing your interviews when you’re not prepared, you can use the same skills to batch your interviews and ultimately control the timing of your job search. What does it mean to control the timing of your job search? Ideally, you want all of your offers to come in at the same time, both because it maximizes optionality (one company that arbitrarily offers first doesn’t rush you into making a decision) and maximizes leverage (you can negotiate from a position of power). If you want to dive deeper into this process, take a look at a book I recently co-wrote, Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. It includes a full chapter about how to manage your job search, which covers everything from determining the order in which to approach companies to how to speed them up and slow them down once you’re in process. There’s a lot more detail than I can touch in this post, and much of it depends on your specific circumstances, but you can probably get 50% of the way there just by postponing your interviews in batches. The big insight here is that, except for the edge cases we discussed above, a recruiting process can be paused at any point. In other words, you can do a bunch of outreach to companies, then do a bunch of enthusiastic recruiter calls, and THEN pause all the processes until you’re prepared to do technical phone screens. Then, you batch the phone screens. Finally, if needed, you pause again to give yourself time to prepare for onsites. Onsite interviews require a different skill set than technical phone screens. The technical phone screen isn’t about depth or fit — it’s just a way to cut people who aren’t likely to pass the onsite. The onsite, on the other hand, isn’t just meant to cut poor performers. It’s at once a deeper dive into your technical ability and a way to gauge fit. If you’ll be interviewing with your future team (typical at companies with a decentralized process), it’s also meant to assess your ability to work together, collaborate on hard things, complement the team's existing skillset, and so on. It usually has some coding (to verify that your technical phone screen wasn’t a fluke), but the focus is usually on system design and behavioral interviews2, which are also the interviews commonly used for leveling decisions. So, onsite prep is much more about system design and getting your stories right for your behavioral interviews. Some people can pull off prepping for both coding and sys design/behavioral at the same time. For many, depending on their existing familiarity with the material, it’s a tall order. So, it’s wise to take the time you need and prepare. Then, once you’re ready, you batch the onsites. When your offers come in, you should ask for extensions as needed, speed companies up, and start negotiating (which we’ve written about in the past and which, of course, is covered at great depth in the book). Footnotes: Footnotes Yes, it’s true that in 2022, we saw several FAANGs and many other companies freeze hiring, and if you had postponed your interviews, you’d have been left out in the cold. Despite how devastating these freezes were to affected candidates (and to the tech economy as whole), they are extremely rare, and in our humble opinion, not worth optimizing for or worrying about. You are very unlikely to have to deal with an impending freeze. ↩ Some companies will also have technical deep dives, project presentations, assessments of niche skills, and so on. ↩ Life is chaos and pain.

Here's the table of contents: I have some exciting news. Along with Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Mike Mroczka, and Nil Mamano, I’m writing the official sequel to Cracking the Coding Interview (often called the bible of technical interview prep). It's fittingly called Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. I’ve always wanted to write a book about technical interviewing. And this is it. And of course it'll draw on all the hiring data we've collected over the past decade at interviewing.io. Technical interviews are much harder today than they used to be. Engineers study for months and routinely get down-leveled despite that. Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview, in addition to covering a bunch of new questions and topics, teaches you how to think instead of memorizing. Grinding and memorization isn’t the way in this market (though in fairness, it’s never really the way). With us, you’ll still have to do the work, of course, but we’ll teach you to work smarter. We added at least thirteen new technical topics (I say “at least” because we’re still writing, and it might be more like twenty)—and over 150 new problems. Each problem includes step-by-step walkthroughs, and you can work each problem with our (actually good) AI Interviewer. And of course this book was written in partnership with interviewing.io. We’ve pulled in data from over 100k FAANG mock interviews on interviewing.io, and we include hundreds of curated interview replays from interviewing.io (shared with permission of course) – watch people make mistakes and learn so you’re not doomed to repeat them. But it’s not just about interview prep. In today’s job market, the bar is higher but it’s also harder than ever to get noticed and run your job search end-to-end. My excellent co-authors killed it on the technical chapters. I focused on writing the job search stuff, including, but not limited to: How to negotiate, exactly what to say, and how to not screw up your negotiations before they even start How to manage your job search, end to end, and balance interview prep with applications and outreach A worksheet to help you figure out what order you need to engage with the companies you’re targeting to ensure that all your offers come in at the same time How to get in the door at top companies without relying on referrals, including email templates and examples of good and bad outreach An internal look at FAANG (and other) company rubrics to help understand what interviewers really care about, no matter what company you're applying to What you need to know about behavioral interviews, whether you want to or not, and how to avoid the mistakes that even great engineers make A list of very specific questions to ask your interviewers (not just to look smart but to learn useful things) How technical interviews got to be so broken and how to get over hating them so you can win I also spend some time on owning and sharing data on how flawed technical interviewing is and, most importantly, how to manage your psychology so you can get past that. I see so many engineers opting out of this interview style, arguably for good reason. But you’re leaving a lot of good opportunities on the table, and it doesn’t have to be like that. This book is so much of what I’ve blogged about for the last 15 years, but it’s fleshed out with much more detail and actionable advice. If you read it, let me know what you think. Technical interviewing sucks (and so does looking for a job). But this book will help you do it well and get out alive. Purchases of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview get a $50 discount for interviewing.io. The book costs $45, so it’s not a bad deal.

Read 9 chapters for free →interviewing.ioOpen menuInterview resourcesFor employersGift mock interviewsBlogFAQLog inGive it a tryBlog HomeI love meritocracy, but all the recent anti-DEI rhetoric is badBy Aline Lerner | Published: October 3, 2024; Last updated: October 31, 2024I’m the founder of interviewing.io, an anonymous technical recruiting marketplace. In some ways, I’m the meritocracy hipster who was writing about how eng hiring should be meritocratic and about how quotas are bad, way before saying either was cool. At interviewing.io, my team and I have been trying to make hiring meritocratic for the last decade. Briefly, we do anonymous mock interviews. If people perform well in those interviews, they get introduced directly to decision-makers at top-tier companies, regardless of how they look on paper. 40% of the thousands of people we’ve helped were excellent engineers who did not look good on paper and would NOT have gotten in the door through traditional, “meritocratic” channels. Many of those engineers were rejected based on their resumes by the very same companies where they were later hired through us. Recently, there’s been a lot of pro-meritocracy, anti-DEI rhetoric. The most salient example is Alexandr Wang’s (CEO of Scale AI) tweet about how their hiring process has to be meritocratic (including a catchy new acronym, “MEI”). Today we’ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.This is the email I’ve shared with our @scale\\_AI team.———————————————————MERITOCRACY AT SCALEIn the wake of our fundraise, I’ve been getting a lot of questions…— Alexandr Wang (@alexandr\\_wang) June 13, 2024 The post got a resounding “Great!” from Elon Musk a half hour later, followed by a wall of accolades from the Twitterverse. Since then, a “meritocracy board” has sprung up as well. If you read Wang’s post carefully, you’ll see that he provides no specific examples of how Scale AI makes hiring meritocratic and doesn’t share any details about their current hiring process. I don’t know anyone from the Scale AI team personally, but after doing eng hiring in some form or another for over 15 years, I have questions. Does Scale AI’s hiring process differ substantially from other companies’? Or are they doing the same thing as everyone else: recruiters look at resumes, pick people who have top brands on their resume, and interview them? If their process is indeed like everyone else’s, no matter what they say, they’re no more meritocratic than the companies who tout DEI hiring practices… and are just virtue signaling on Twitter. I’ll be the first to admit that DEI is ideologically flawed because of its emphasis on race and gender-based outcomes and its insistence on equality of those outcomes. In the last decade, we’ve seen some pretty bad DEI practices, the most egregious being a company looking up candidate photos on LinkedIn and rejecting qualified white, male candidates. (I talk more about the worst-offending hiring practices I’ve seen over the last decade in the section called The dark side of diversity… and two stories of diversity initiatives gone wrong below. If you just want the juicy bits, read that part.) However, yelling “Meritocracy!” as if it’s a fait accompli is just as harmful as the worst parts of DEI. In the last decade, we’ve seen countless companies claim to be meritocratic but refuse to talk to candidates unless they had a CS degree from one of a select few schools. There is nothing meritocratic about that. After seeing the pendulum swing back and forth a bunch in this space, I’d even go so far to say that, ironically, the DEI movement has done more for meritocracy than the loud pro-meritocracy movement is doing right now. I’m delighted that “meritocracy” is no longer a dirty word. But, just saying it isn’t enough. We have to change our hiring practices. We need to stop using meritocracy as a shield to preserve the status quo. If we could instead put into practice the best part of DEI – openness to hiring candidates from non-traditional backgrounds while eliminating the toxic hyperfocus on race and gender and the insistence on equality of outcomes, then we could create a real meritocracy, which is what most reasonable people actually want.1 A quick disclaimer before we go further. To the right, DEI has come to mean mediocrity, and as such, it’s pitted, apples to apples, against meritocracy. That is not the intent here. When I talk about DEI, I’m not talking about the political side of it or how it’s often co-opted by the left as a gateway to Marxism. Similarly, meritocracy has been co-opted by the right to justify racism, eugenics, and god knows what other horrid things. Both extremes are bad. I’m trying to shed all political associations from either word and to just talk about them purely as hiring ideologies. DEI’s outcomes problem On its face, increasing diversity sounds great. Some groups are underrepresented in tech, likely because of inequality of opportunity. Talent is distributed uniformly, opportunity is not. Let’s fix it! Twitter threads like this one (from an engineering leader at Google) are hard to argue with. You should read the whole thing — it’s about a (white) lumberjack’s son who ended up as one of the founding employees at SpaceX. Everyone loves SpaceX, and thinks of Elon as the genius founder that invents new types of rockets that are cheaper, faster, more efficient.It's fun to think of it as SpaceX versus NASA, or Silicon Valley vs Aerospace.But let's talk about D&I, and logs. Logs as in timber. 🌲— Mekka 💉x7 @mekkaokereke@hachyderm.io (@mekkaokerekebye) January 5, 2019 And indeed, ostensibly, DEI is hard to argue against because it speaks to our innate desire for fairness and equal access to opportunity. Many DEI leaders honestly believe this. However, despite the good intentions, in practice, DEI tends to laser focus on race and gender outcomes, and that is hard to argue for. Over the years, I’ve seen claims that diverse teams perform better, as well as claims that one must have a diverse workforce if one has a diverse customer base. Though it’s often stated as fact, the former is inconclusive — there are studies with clear results for AND clear results against.2 To the best of my knowledge, the latter point is unsubstantiated as well — isn’t the hallmark of a good designer that they be able to design for customers who are different than they are?3 The arguments for diversity are inconclusive, and as such, the ultimate measure of success for diversity isn’t about the performance of an organization or about customer satisfaction. Those are packaged up as obvious side benefits. The way we measure success for diversity is tautological: success is measured by the diversity of our workforce. What does that mean? In practice, recruiting orgs usually define success by looking at some demographic and its representation in the general population. So, in the case of women in tech, women make up half the U.S. population, so 50% of engineers in an organization should be women. Similarly, 12% of the U.S. population is Black, so for hiring to be equitable, 12% of the engineers in an organization should be Black. Likewise, 19% of the U.S. population is Hispanic, so 19% of engineers should be Hispanic, and so on. What’s the problem with this approach? It does not account for inputs. The most basic input is: How many female engineers are there in the US? And how many Black or Hispanic engineers are there in the US? The answer: not enough. Only 20% of CS graduates in the US are women. And there are also not enough engineers of color to get to race parity either. Only 6% of CS graduates in the US are Black, and only 7% are Hispanic.4 Those numbers get even more grim when you pare them down to how companies usually hire: from top-ranked schools. We’ll talk more about this pedigree-based approach to hiring when we discuss the pitfalls of meritocracy. For now, suffice it to say that a few years ago, we ran the numbers to show that getting to gender parity in software engineering is mathematically impossible given companies’ focus on pedigree; though it was unfashionable to admit it, we called out that there really is a pipeline problem. And then there’s this issue: What portion of those candidates are even applying to your company in the first place? And what portion of those applicants are actually qualified to do the work? The ONLY way to really take race and gender bias off the table is to do blind as much of the hiring process as possible and then to accept that you may not get the numbers you want but that your outcomes will actually be fair. The dark side of diversity (and two stories of diversity initiatives gone wrong) In addition to mock interviews, interviewing.io also helps companies source engineering candidates. We know how people perform in mock interviews, and that lets us reliably predict who’ll do well in real interviews. We identify the top performers from practice and introduce them to companies. We’ve been doing it for a while, and our top performers have consistently outperformed candidates from other sources by about 3X. I promised in the beginning of this post that I’d spill some juicy tidbits. Here goes. Years ago, we pitched Facebook’s university recruiting team on using us to hire for their intern class. The pitch was that we had thousands of college students from all over the U.S. who had done a bunch of mock interviews, and that we knew who the top performers were. Many of our students did NOT come from the handful of top-tier schools that Meta typically recruited from. If they were to recruit through us, they’d have to do way fewer interviews (we had already taken care of technical vetting), and they’d get a much more diverse slice of the population. Our only process request was that they conduct interviews with students anonymously, on our platform, so they wouldn’t be biased against top-performing students who didn’t go to top schools. We didn’t get the gig. The main bit of pushback from Facebook was that anonymity violated guidelines set by the OFCCP. The OFCCP (Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs) is part of the U.S. Department of Labor and is “responsible for ensuring that employers doing business with the Federal government comply with the laws and regulations requiring nondiscrimination.” One of the many things that the OFCCP requires you to track, if you do business with the federal government, is the race and gender of your applicants. We couldn’t agree to this. While the requirement makes sense on the surface — as they say, you can’t fix what you can’t measure — in this case, it was a Kafkaesque roadblock to achieving the very thing that the OFCCP is fighting for: reducing discrimination.5 More broadly, you can’t take an outcomes-based approach unless your inputs are homogenous and the playing field is level. The biggest advocates of DEI will argue, correctly, that the playing field is not level. Given that it’s not level, focusing exclusively on outcomes creates all manners of perverse incentives — the dark side of diversity is the logical conclusion of an outcomes-based approach: incentivizing the selection of candidates based on race and gender and ultimately discriminating against non-URM candidates. We’ve worked with companies of all sizes, from seed stage startups to FAANG, and at one point or another, we’ve worked with most FAANGs and FAANG-adjacent companies. We’ve seen it all. In 2022, at the height of diversity fever, one well-known FAANG-adjacent customer approached us with a specific request. Let’s call them AcmeCorp (name obviously changed; they’re a household name, but I don’t want to rake them over the coals publicly because they were a great partner to us until this thing happened). AcmeCorp’s recruiting team wanted us to do some pre-filtering on the candidates we introduced to them. We already do some pre-filtering: location, years of experience, visa status, and obviously historical performance in mock interviews. Only the top few percent of our candidates get to talk to employers. But on our platform, everything is candidate driven. We don’t have a searchable candidate database, and we don’t share candidate data with companies. Rather, we list the companies who hire through us, and our top-performing users can connect with them. Over our lifetime, plenty of companies have approached us asking if they could get access to just top-performing women and people of color on our platform. It makes sense. Recruiters are given marching orders to find more “diverse” candidates, and this is the result. And it’s a convenient way to pass on liability. Now, instead of their sourcers having to filter out candidates who aren’t “diverse”, we have to do it. Of course, we’ve always denied these requests. We’re not a “diversity” platform, and we can’t imagine a world where we’d block what jobs and employers our users could see based on their race and gender (information we don’t collect systematically in the first place).6 Even though, on their face, these requests weren’t really OK, we got so many of them that, over time, we got desensitized and would joke internally about how yet another company wanted a binder full of women. However, AcmeCorp’s request was more egregious than the rest because it gave us visibility into how many companies were behaving internally when faced with diversity goals. It was common knowledge that many companies were doing diversity-specific sourcing, so we weren’t shocked when we were asked to help with that. What wasn’t common knowledge is that companies were blatantly rejecting qualified applicants who didn’t meet their diversity criteria. AcmeCorp had a fairly complex candidate filtering process in place, and they wanted us to run that same process on any of our top performers who expressed interest in working there. Here’s how their process worked. Note that AcmeCorp, like many companies, pays differently depending on where you live. List a remote job that’s hiring all over the United States. When candidates apply from high cost of living areas (e.g., the SF Bay Area, NYC), only consider women and people of color. Reject the rest. When candidates apply from lower cost of living areas (e.g., small towns in the Midwest), consider everyone. In other words, a white man from San Francisco would have no shot at getting an interview at this company — he would be auto-rejected and left to wonder what was wrong with his resume. Why did this company take this approach? They were willing to pay top dollar for women and people of color but not for other types of engineers, and they hid behind geography to do it. Because of the geographical element, it’s not as blatant as outright rejecting people based on race and gender, but for all intents and purposes, it’s the same. Outside of this practice being questionably legal at best, it’s also unethical. You can argue that companies should be able to do outreach to any demographic groups that they want. It’s much harder to argue that it’s ok to reject applicants based on their race and gender. We terminated the relationship.7 Unfortunately, when you tie the success of your recruiting program to gender and race outcomes, these are the behaviors that inevitably arise. For all its flaws, though, the DEI movement, coupled with increasing demand for engineers, propelled companies to make deep changes to their hiring processes. For every DEI horror story, there is an equal and opposing story about a Head of Talent or investor engineering leader who persuaded their eng hiring managers to stop looking just at students from MIT and Stanford, to change their interview processes, to blind resumes, and to do a bunch of other useful things that benefitted every non-traditional candidate. But, back to what’s happening today. You don’t just get to say “meritocracy” and be done with it. In practice, meritocratic hiring doesn’t really exist, and what companies call meritocracy is anything but. The false promise of meritocracy For most sane people, the concept of meritocracy is hard to argue against. Shouldn’t the most qualified person get the job? Unfortunately, because the definition of “qualified” is murky, meritocracy often becomes a justification for over-indexing on pedigree: where people went to school or where they worked previously. “We just hire the best” often means “we hire people from FAANG, MIT, and Stanford.” Unfortunately, those are proxies for ability, not actual measures of it. Our research has consistently shown that where people go to school isn’t very predictive of what they can do. Where they’ve worked is somewhat predictive, but it’s not the most important thing.8 Despite that, those are the main criteria that companies use when they decide whom to interview, and because that’s the first step in a hiring funnel, it’s the one that gets applied to the most candidates. Any attempts at making the process meritocratic after the resume review (e.g., training interviewers, doing anonymous interviews) are bound to be less impactful because they affect 10X-100X fewer candidates. Fortunately, for all their flaws, at least technical interviews do focus on ability — once you get in the door, it’s not about how you look on paper but about how you perform. As a result, all other things being equal, how you decide which candidates to let into your process is the litmus test for whether your process is truly meritocratic or not. Unfortunately, the pedigree-based approach isn’t particularly meritocratic. In our 9 years, we’ve diligently tracked the backgrounds of our candidates, and as I mentioned in the intro to this post, about 40% of our top performers don’t look good on paper (but do as well as or outperform their pedigreed counterparts in interviews). One of our users got rejected from a top-tier social network company three times… THREE TIMES… based on his resume before he got hired there through us, after doing very well in an anonymous interview. I’ve shared a few diversity horror stories, but the sad reality is that (faux) meritocracy horror stories like this one happen every day. I wish I had a real meritocracy horror story to share, but as far as I know, eng hiring has never been truly meritocratic. If you know otherwise, please do share. Our data also shows that pedigree has very little bearing on interview performance. Where people went to school has no bearing on their interview performance, and though where people have worked does carry some signal, it’s not nearly as important as other traits — in past research, we’ve found that not having typos/grammatical errors on your resume is a much stronger signal than whether they’ve worked at a top company, as is whether they’ve done a lot of autodidactic work.8 Moreover, in two separate studies completed a decade apart, where recruiters had to judge resumes and try to pick out the strong candidates, we consistently saw that recruiters are only as accurate as a coin flip and largely disagree with each other about what a good candidate looks like.9 That’s why posts like the one from Scale AI get my hackles up. You don’t get to say that you’re meritocratic if you’re just scanning resumes for top brands. That’s not meritocracy. It’s co-opting a hot-button word for clout. And it’s not just Scale AI. This is how tech companies define being meritocratic and hiring the best. It’s just that not all of them are so self-congratulatory about it. So how do you ensure that your hiring is actually meritocratic? How to actually “do” meritocracy, if you mean it In a recent study, we looked at how recruiters read resumes and how good they are at finding talent. As you saw above, we learned that recruiters are barely better than a coin flip. Another thing we looked at in the same study was what made them pick certain resumes over others. The two traits that were the most predictive of whether a recruiter would pick you? First, whether you had top brands on your resume, and second, whether you were Black or Hispanic. This is how recruiters work today. If you don’t intervene and make changes, today’s competing approaches will both be implemented by your team simultaneously, resulting in a farcical chimera of fake meritocracy and outcomes-based diversity goals. So what can you actually do, if you, in good faith, want to run a meritocratic hiring process? (By the way, if you believe that talent is distributed uniformly, by definition, this approach will entail being open to talent from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds.) First, you have to move away from identity politics and expand the definition of “underrepresented.” You have to believe, in your heart of hearts, that great talent can come from anywhere and must stop focusing arbitrarily on one marginalized group at the expense of another. Basically, you have to be open to any candidate who’s good, regardless of how they look on paper, without prioritizing race and gender. This certainly includes race and gender, but it also includes socioeconomic status, educational background (or lack thereof), and any number of other traits that have nothing to do with someone’s ability to do the job. Hell, why not just stop worrying about candidate backgrounds and have a process that welcomes all and surfaces the best? Following this path will logically require moving away from race and gender outcomes-based goals. Then, you have to accept and internalize that your current method of deciding who gets to interview, which is very likely focused on brands (where people have worked or where they’ve gone to school), is not only NOT meritocratic but also ineffective. We talked above about how pedigree is very limited in its ability to predict performance. If you accept both of these premises — expanding the definition of “underrepresented” and moving away from focusing on brands — the hard work begins. Companies have used resumes (and brands by extension) since time immemorial because they’re easy, and as you saw in our data above, they do carry some signal. But even though they carry a little signal, recruiters are not very good at extracting it. Here’s what you should do to pragmatically and realistically revamp your hiring process to be more meritocratic. I challenge Scale AI and all the leaders on the “meritocracy board” to publicly commit to at least two of these — or to name the specific, actionable approaches they plan to take. Change how you read resumes.10 Give candidates the option of submitting some writing about a past project they’re proud of. Give candidates the option of doing a take-home or an asynchronous assessment. Put enough work into those assignments such that you’ll trust their outcome enough to not have to look at a resume. \\[EXTRA CREDIT\\] Invest what you can in closing the gaps. Change how you read resumes First, SLOW DOWN. In the study I mentioned above, we saw that recruiters take a median of 31 seconds to judge a resume, but spending just 15 extra seconds reading a resume could improve your accuracy by 34%. Our second piece of advice is this. More than 20 years ago, Freada Kapor Klein from Kapor Capital coined the term “distance traveled,” referring to what someone accomplished, in the context of where they started. For instance, Kapor Klein recommends that, in their admissions processes, universities should consider not just the number of AP tests a candidate has passed but the number of AP tests taken divided by the total number offered at their high school. For example, if an applicant took 5 AP tests and their school offered 27, that paints a very different picture from another applicant who also took 5 AP tests when that’s the total number offered at their school. Kapor Capital uses distance traveled as one of their metrics for determining which entrepreneurs to fund. One can easily apply this concept to hiring as well. The data shows that slowing down is important, and as part of slowing down, when you read a resume, try to evaluate candidates’ achievements, not in a vacuum, but in the context of where they came from. Think about the denominator. But don’t think for a moment that we recommend that you lower the bar — absolutely not. On interviewing.io, we regularly see nontraditional candidates objectively outperforming their FAANG counterparts. Give candidates the option of submitting some writing about a past project they’re proud of My friends at KeepSafe and I ran an experiment about a decade ago where we tried replacing resumes with a writing sample about a past project. It was a huge success. Even today, when we hire at interviewing.io, we use this approach. We mostly hire off of our own platform (we just list our own open positions alongside others). However, not all of our users have done enough mock interviews to have a rating, and for those users, we have a different flow where we ask them to write about a past project. Boy, are the results telling. Here’s what our application form looks like. Steal it if you want. Give candidates the option of doing a take-home or an asynchronous assessment Take-homes and asynchronous assessments are not well-loved by candidates, primarily because of value asymmetry. They ask a lot of the candidate but nothing of the company, and it’s not uncommon for a candidate to have to do hours of work and then never hear anything back. To be clear, this is NOT the setup we’re advocating. Here’s what we’d advise instead: Give candidates the option of doing a take-home/assessment that takes no more than 1 hour, instead of submitting their resume. When we say option, we mean that the candidate can decide whether they want to do the take-home or not. If they choose not to, then you’ll read their resume, hopefully using our suggestions above. If they choose to complete the take-home, then you forgo their resume and make your go/no-go decision based entirely on the results of the take-home. If you choose this route, it’s critical to come up with an assessment whose results you trust. Many companies use a take-home in addition to getting the resume and will still not move forward with candidates who look good on paper. That’s not meritocratic. Take the time you need to come up with a question that’s hard to cheat on and that gets you the signal you need. Yes, coming up with a good assessment takes work. But no one said that making your hiring process meritocratic was easy. \\[EXTRA CREDIT\\] Invest what you can in closing the gaps This advice probably applies more to big companies than smaller ones, because bigger ones have more resources to effect change. Regardless, if you believe in meritocracy, then you understand that a true meritocracy is not possible without a level playing field for your candidates. One of the best things about the DEI movement is that it’s made us aware how unlevel the playing field really is. Whether you subscribe to DEI or not, this is probably not a controversial statement, and if you want to see true, meritocratic hiring, you have some obligation to help promote equality of opportunity. Where to begin? Although I expect that it’s not level in many places, and there are plenty of opportunities to effect change, starting with elementary education11, I'll talk about the inequality I’ve observed firsthand repeatedly over the last decade: the technical interview practice gap. How much you practice is the biggest predictive factor of interview performance — not seniority, not gender, and not a CS degree. And so is socialization. After all, if you’re around people going through the same thing, like at a top-tier CS school, rather than beating yourself up after a disappointing interview, you’ll start to internalize that technical interviewing is flawed and that the outcomes are sometimes unpredictable. Fortunately, there are interventions one can make to close these gaps, and the simplest is to provide practice and community for people who don’t have access to them. Reach out to us about this, find a non-profit that helps people practice, donate to your favorite university if they have a good practice program, or any number of other things. Ultimately, which gap you choose to help close and how you choose to do it is up to you. But if your company has the means, it’s your responsibility to invest in gap-closing measures. You don’t have to donate money. You can offer mock interviews to your candidates before their real interviews. You can start an apprenticeship program. You can encourage your engineers to do some tutoring. However you approach it, though, you can’t talk about meritocracy with a straight face and not do something to level the playing field. Footnotes: Footnotes In fairness, the Scale AI post positioned them as symbiotic. I believe that as well. ↩ There are many sources arguing for and against diversity leading to better-performing teams. Here are some examples: For: https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters Against: https://medium.com/the-liberators/in-depth-the-double-edged-sword-of-diversity-in-teams-765ff72a55da (except for “age diversity”) and https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/05/25/diversity-and-performance-in-entrepreneurial-teams/ ↩ One of the most insulting examples of the “we need a diverse workforce to serve our diverse customer base” argument occurred when I was pitching Amazon on using interviewing.io to hire. This was years ago, and back then, out of curiosity, I’d always ask the organizations we were pitching why they valued diversity. I don’t think I ever got a good answer, but this one was especially bad. One of the recruiters we met with went on a long diatribe about how Amazon sells lots of shoes and you need women on the eng team because women understand shoes better than men. ↩ Getting more women and people of color to study computer science is a worthy cause. Hell, getting anyone who’s historically been marginalized to study computer science is worthwhile. It’s great for our economy, and it’s currently one of the best levers for upward social mobility available. But, while we hope more companies do these things, it is not reasonable to expect that companies can be responsible for educational interventions that often need to start at the elementary school level. Of course, companies should do what they can. But expecting them to pull off mathematical impossibilities is irrational, and the DEI movement’s stalwart refusal to acknowledge the pipeline problem undermines the movement as a whole. ↩ I was actually able to get in touch with a former OFCCP higher-up who admitted that rejecting anonymity in hiring was against the spirit of OFCCP requirements. But they sadly wouldn’t go on the record. ↩ The closest we’ve ever come to doing this is our Fellowship program, where we gave free practice to engineers from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. It was a great program, but what made it great was that our interviewers were eager to help these candidates. We were able to do free practice because our interviewers graciously agreed not to charge. That said, if I were to run this program again, I’d probably focus more on socioeconomic status and non-traditional credentials rather than just race and gender. ↩ Here’s the email we ended the relationship with. I’m including it because it was hard to write and even harder to hit send on, but I think we did the right thing, and maybe someone else will need to write something like this in the future… in which case, please steal our copy. ↩ Research that shows that having attended a top school isn’t very predictive and that, while experience at a top company is somewhat predictive, it’s not the most important thing: Lessons from 3,000 technical interviews… or how what you do after graduation matters way more than where you went to school We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered.

Until recently, I was stalwartly against resumes and convinced that they carried no signal whatsoever.

Here's the data.By Mike Mroczka | Published: September 12, 2024; Last updated: September 13, 2024Mike MroczkaMike Mroczka, a former senior SWE (Google, Salesforce, GE), is the primary author of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview—the official sequel to Gayle McDowell's original CTCI. He works as a tech consultant and has a decade of experience helping engineers land their dream jobs. He’s a top-rated mentor (interviewing.io, Karat, Pathrise, Skilled.inc) and the author of viral technical content on system design and technical interview strategies featured on HackerNews, Business Insider, and Wired. He also sometimes writes technical content for interviewing.io (like this piece) and was one of the authors of interviewing.io’s A Senior Engineer's Guide to the System Design Interview. You can find him online at mikemroczka.com, LinkedIn, and X. Have you ever wondered if you should spend more time on LeetCode, participate in those contests, or focus on solving harder problems? A popular Reddit post suggests you need 700+ questions and a LeetCode rating between 1800-2000 to pass FAANG interviews. Is this really what the data supports? To answer these questions and more, we looked at our users' LeetCode ranks and ratings and tied them back to interview performance on our platform and whether those users worked at FAANG. In this post, we’ll share what we’ve learned. The experiment interviewing.io is an interview practice platform and recruiting marketplace for engineers. Engineers use us for mock interviews. Companies use us to hire top performers. Hundreds of thousands of engineers have used our platform to prepare for interviews, and we have performance data for over 100k technical interviews (split between real interviews and mocks). We surveyed almost 700 of our users and asked them to share their LeetCode and LinkedIn profiles. From those profiles, we pulled our users’ employment history, as well as their LeetCode data: number of problems worked, ratings, and, if they had it, contest performance. Finally, we cross-referenced all this data with their performance in mock and real interviews on interviewing.io. This data set allowed us to start asking interesting questions. How much LeetCoding is useful? What kinds of problems are most useful to practice? How does LeetCode performance relate to performance in interviews with real people? Do LeetCode contest scores predict interview performance, and is a competitive coder likelier to work at a big tech company? Are hard questions worth solving or should we just stick with mediums? Let's find out! Results The matrix below summarizes our findings. In addition to all LeetCode fields listed below, we also looked into global ratings and contest ratings. It was harder to find a large enough sample size to see any effect of those who did contests. Since the results were not large enough to be informative we have excluded them from the rest of this piece. All findings listed below are statistically significant, with lighter squares indicating stronger correlations. For each profile, we looked at the following attributes: Total questions: the total number of questions solved on LeetCode Hard questions: the number of \"hard\" questions solved on LeetCode Medium questions: the number of \"medium\" questions solved on LeetCode Easy questions: the number of \"easy\" questions solved on LeetCode Worked at FAANG: whether or not the user has ever worked at a FAANG company interviewing.io percentile: how an interviewing.io user stacks up against other users of the platform, after having completed at least one interview How LeetCode attributes relate to having worked at FAANG and performance in mock and real interviews on interviewing.io. Correlations range from 1 (directly positively correlated) to -1 (directly negatively correlated). 0 means there’s no relationship. This matrix summarizes the correlations between LeetCode attributes (y axis) with 1) whether people worked at a FAANG and 2) how well they performed in interviews on interviewing.io (x axis). The higher the number (and the darker the color), the stronger the relationship. For instance, the number of questions a user solved correlates with working at a FAANG company and a user’s percentile ranking on interviewing.io. We see that it is a stronger predictor of interview performance than it is for working at a FAANG company (0.27 and 0.17, respectively). Let's dig into the most exciting findings! The total number of questions you have completed matters! Unsurprisingly, the total number of questions a user has completed correlates with having FAANG on their resume and doing well in technical interviews. Those who work at FAANG companies appear to have completed more questions than those who do not. Don't fret, though, as this doesn't mean you're doomed to be behind people who have started sooner and have amassed thousands of questions. The vast majority of our top users stop LeetCoding after they've hit about 500 questions. Only a fraction of top users have done more than ~500 questions, and only about 10 did more than a thousand questions. As you might expect, there are seriously diminishing returns associated with doing more than 500 questions. Those who continued past the 500 questions performed only marginally better than those who had stopped near 500. In the zero-sum interviewing game, those who complete the most LeetCode questions generally get the highest interview scores and work at the most desirable tech companies, but completing ~500 questions will put you among the top talent in the current market. The difficulty level you attempt matters, too! It is common wisdom on the LeetCode discussion board and subreddits to \"do medium questions, not hard questions,\" with the argument that companies don't ask LeetCode hards. Does this advice stand up to scrutiny? Mostly no. The data shows a clear bias towards those who solved more challenging problems, the exact point at which this matters is up for debate. At interviewing.io we find that before tackling difficult questions, you just need to first start doing problems. Getting started matters more than attempting to complete a particular question difficulty, so don't focus arbitrarily on medium/hard questions, just focus on practicing! Tip 1: Start with anything. Getting started matters more than picking the perfect set of questions. For those just starting, you might think, \"I'm a straight-A student and a fast learner, so I should be able to manage hard questions.\" Don't make this mistake, or you'll burn out quickly. Instead, just focus on doing questions and getting into the habit of translating your thoughts into code efficiently. Those who solved more challenging questions needed to do far fewer questions to have the same chance of getting into a FAANG company Those who solved more challenging questions needed to do far fewer questions to have a high interviewing.io percentile Before tackling mediums and hards, we need to first get good at easy questions. Once we can tackle mediums, for each additional 50 questions you complete, you increase your score of passing your interviews by three percentage points. On the other hand, a LeetCode hard carries over twice the benefits of a medium question. Completing 50 hard questions increases your interview score by seven percentage points! Our data shows that you'd need to complete close to 233 medium questions to get the same benefits that 100 hard questions would give. Consider these two people (fictitious but inspired by real examples in our data): Question DifficultyAlexKaraEasy5025Medium63050Hard10135Total690210 These two people are statistically likely to have similar interview scores, yet Kara completed half the number of questions Alex did. While it goes against standard advice, harder questions having a higher benefit make sense. A LeetCode medium tends to require you to do one thing (perform a DFS, scan an array, etc.) to get the correct answer. In contrast, hard questions require you to do multiple things (memoize results while performing a DFS, tally prefix sums while scanning an array, etc.). The compounding nature of multiple tasks in harder questions necessitates deeper learning in fewer questions. Admittedly, there is a chicken-and-egg scenario going on here. Naively, one might think everyone should just do hard questions, but that doesn't work in practice. Jumping straight to hard questions is an infeasible leap for most people, and the reason many people can complete hard questions is precisely because they have finished many medium questions first. Our advice is not to jump to hard questions immediately. Instead, you should be mindful and not stay at the medium difficulty level longer than necessary. It isn't that the advice to \"do medium questions\" is wrong—it is just overused. It is natural to want to be able to complete a question regularly in a short period of time. Still, if you find yourself completing LeetCode mediums quickly, it indicates that you have stagnated and would be better off moving on to hards. If you have solved 100 or more medium questions, you'll likely get more bang for your buck by transitioning to hard. Tip 2: Don't ignore hard questions. Balance your medium questions with the hard ones. The compounding nature of multiple tasks in harder questions necessitates deeper learning in fewer questions. Finally, we must also acknowledge that not all hard questions are created equal. This tip is my gut feeling, and we don't have data to back it up, but intuitively, we've all done hard questions that seem impossible, hard questions that seemed like they should have been rated medium, and even medium questions that seem like they should have been hard. Question difficulty is somewhat subjective, so if you focus on hard questions, choose questions with a high acceptance rating and/or ones that are \"frequently asked.\" These questions tend to be achievable (they don't have a single impossible trick you need to just have known), realistic (they don't test nonsense algorithms no one knows like Manacher’s algorithm), and solution-flexible (there is often more than one valid approach). Tip 3: When choosing hard questions, pick popular questions. They are more likely to be achievable, realistic, and solution-flexible, which will likely result in more learning per question. Contests and rankings don't matter Surprisingly, we found no correlation between LeetCode ratings and their interviewing percentile. Those who were great at contests also didn't appear more likely to have FAANG on their resume. Two confounding variables that might have caused these unexpected results are: Small contest selection size: Despite our best efforts, we received a relatively small group of candidates that attended any number of contests, let alone several. The data set may be too small to find a correlation. Biased candidate selection: We incentivized candidates with free interviews, so those who regularly complete contests (and therefore have a lot of practice and likely feel confident in their skills) might not be interested in the rewards and weren't studied in this experiment. Tip 4: Don't worry about contests unless you enjoy them. They provide a way to practice managing your time and keep yourself honest with how fast you are moving, but they don't contribute much to your success apart from containing more questions for you to attempt. Conclusion In the end, LeetCode questions are a reasonable proxy for predictors of interview performance. While ratings and contest scores don't seem to matter,1 questions —and question difficulty—do. Focus on tackling increasingly difficult questions until you've hit that point of diminishing returns near ~500. Don't stagnate with medium questions; pick popular and frequently asked hard questions, too. And don't stress if your friend has a higher LeetCode score than you do; turns out it doesn't mean much! Footnotes: Footnotes A caveat here is that, strictly speaking, we're reporting correlations—not necessarily causal relationships. This leaves open the possibility that what we were measuring was not exactly a return to LeetCode but rather the effect of some third variable that increases both LeetCode activity and job prospects. For example, say MIT has a course that emphasizes coding puzzles, and MIT grads also get better jobs. In that case, what might look like a LeetCode benefit is actually an MIT benefit, and controlling for that would make the apparent benefit disappear. At the very least, though, these patterns are informative about the typical profile of successful engineers, which is likely a useful thing to emulate in general. Also, remember that our data still shows solving a healthy number of questions regardless of their difficulty can boost your chances of getting through difficult interviews. By definition, many people can pass interviews with far fewer problems completed, and many will pass after doing more problems. ↩ Life is chaos and pain.

Part 2 of 2.By Aline Lerner | Published: July 31, 2024; Last updated: November 3, 2024In part 1 of this post, we talked about which channels are most effective for getting in the door and did an analysis of those channels along two axes: effectiveness and how much control you actually have. Here’s a quick summary. In the quadrant above, you can see that while getting contacted by an in-house recruiter is very effective, whether you get contacted or not is largely out of your hands. The channel that maximizes both effectiveness and control is cold outreach to hiring managers (not recruiters!) “done right”. What does “done right” mean? That’s what we’ll talk about in this post (part 2 of 2). Most people do this type of outreach incorrectly. Here, we’ll get very tactical and tell you exactly what to say and do to reach out to hiring managers at the companies you’re interested in and actually get responses. Here’s our recommended, hyper-practical approach. Prerequisites/tooling Buy a month or two of LinkedIn Sales Navigator. This will run you a few hundred dollars, but it’s worth it. Get an account with an email discovery tool like RocketReach (an excellent email discovery tool). Get Streak, which lets you do mail merges in Gmail. You create an email template, with variables for everything from recipient name to long snippets of personalized text, and then you upload a CSV with all the values. The resulting emails feel personalized but get sent to hundreds of people at once. Treat your job search like a sales funnel If you’re an engineer, chances are you haven’t ever done sales (maybe you had a job in high school selling Cutco knives or magazines, in which case what we’re about to say will resonate). But if you do sales for any appreciable amount of time, you’ll start thinking about everything in life as a funnel. Funnels are wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. That’s why they’re such an apt metaphor for the sales process — you do a lot of outreach, and you don’t get many responses. Of the responses you do get, relatively few will do the thing you want them to do. And even fewer will ultimately “close” (aka, buying — or, in this case, hiring). In your engineering career, you’ve intellectually mastered many abstract concepts that are much more complex than a funnel. Despite its simplicity, however, the funnel is one of the hardest concepts to internalize emotionally, especially for people who are used to having control over outcomes. When you write code for n hours, you can expect that you will build m features. In sales though, you do a lot of work, very little of it will pan out, and when it does pan out, it can feel almost random; an impersonal, mediocre email gets a response while your beautifully targeted email is met with deafening silence. And then there’s rejection. When you apply to jobs online and don’t hear back, it stings, but the sting is softened by the possibility that a human never even saw your application. You’re not reaching out to people when you apply online; you’re dealing with a bureaucratic machine. On the other hand, when you email a real human and they don’t respond, that hurts: you put yourself out there, someone made a value judgment about you, and you lost. The good news is that, after a while, the pain lessens, and you build up some useful emotional calluses and acquire the thousand-yard stare of someone who’s been rejected a million times for a million reasons, ranging from soul-crushingly legitimate to incontrovertibly random. Sadly, there’s no shortcut. You’ve got to do the reps, you’ve got to get the rejections, and you’ve got to pick yourself up again. You get used to it, and then it doesn’t hurt as much, because experience has taught you that if you keep going, you will eventually get to a yes. What to actually do First, come up with a target list of companies. How to do that is out of scope for this post, but we may write about it in the future. For now, we’ll assume you have a list. Once you have your list of companies, use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find hiring managers at those companies (or founders or directors or VPs, as above). Below is an example query where we look for Google hiring managers. You might think that Google is so big that sifting through all their various hiring managers will be intractable. Fortunately, you can whittle down the list to a pretty manageable size by applying some filters. Here are our filters: Just targeting managers, not directors or VPs. Google is a huge organization. You want the people who are most likely to help, and they’re the ones who are struggling to hire for their teams. In position for less than 2 years: These are the people who are still trying to prove themselves and who are less likely to have a long-standing relationship with their recruiter to the point where they only rely on internal recruiting and overlook other sources of candidates. Geography: Let's focus on the places we most want to work. 1st- or 2nd-degree connection: This way, when they look you up, they’ll see some social proof. You can expand this to 3rd-degree connections, if needed. Once you have your list, put their LinkedIn URLs into a spreadsheet. Then, do a pass through your targets’ profiles and see if any of them link to personal websites, social media accounts, blogs, or anything else that will help you find common ground with them. Add any useful links in your spreadsheet because we’ll be mining them when we actually write our emails. Look up their email addresses Once you have your list of LinkedIn URLs, use a tool like RocketReach to look up their emails. Why not reach out on LinkedIn? While recruiters live on LinkedIn, managers generally do not. Possibly, they don't even like or check LinkedIn much. They live in their emails, so that's where you want to target them. RocketReach is a nice tool for email discovery because 1) it takes LinkedIn URLs as inputs and 2) its email database is generally up-to-date and correct.1 If RocketReach fails or you don't wish to pay for it, you might just be able to guess their email address, as email addresses tend to follow common forms: aline@interviewing.io (my actual email address), alerner@interviewing.io, or aline.lerner@interviewing.io. Where possible, contact managers via their work email address.2 In some cases, you won’t be able to find their work email, in which case it’s acceptable to fall back to their personal email. Write succinct, highly personalized emails Next, compose a fairly personalized, yet short, email. All too often, candidates write a long, generic cover letter that’s obviously been sent to a ton of people. I get many emails that look like this: Don’t do this! Don’t do this either! There is nothing here about why this candidate is a good fit for interviewing.io, and the bullets aren’t compelling enough on their own. Note that this particular email is from a marketer, not an engineer, but the anti-patterns are the same. Emails like the above are impersonal, but worst of all, they have a poor signal-to-noise ratio — I want to find a reason to say yes and to invest my valuable time into this person. But they’re not giving me one, and they’re making me work for it in the process. Don't open email with how they found you. This is a big pet peeve of ours. I don’t care how you found me! I know I’m on LinkedIn. What I care about is why talking to you will add value for me or why you’re interesting. Use the most significant real estate in the email, the first sentence, to tell me that! Don't be overly formal in how you address the person. Use their first name. Don't get their gender wrong (e.g., referring to a woman as \"sir\" — you’d be surprised how often this happens). Don't paste in a generic cover letter. These are sure to get ignored immediately — if you’re not going to put in the effort to write to me personally, why would I put in the effort to read your email? Don't forget to include a link to a LinkedIn or a personal website. We don’t recommend attaching your resume, though. It can seem overly formal/somewhat presumptuous if you're trying to build rapport. More broadly, if you want someone to go out on a limb for you, make it dead simple for them to justify expending their social/political capital on you. Hiring managers, as a rule, want to help. Make it a no-brainer for them. There are three components to a great cold email: Common ground with your target Proof that you’re worthy of their time A strong call to action Not every cold email will have (1) because you won’t always be able to find common ground with everyone — there’s simply not enough information out there about some targets to be able to craft a compelling narrative that’s highly personalized to them. But every cold email you write should have (2). It is your job to sell yourself quickly and succinctly. You want your target to feel like they’d be an idiot to pass up the chance to talk to you. Finding common ground The email below is personal, succinct, and finds common ground. Not only that, but it conveniently finds common ground that benefits the candidate (a soft-spot for non-traditional candidates, like himself!). To find common ground, reference something your target cares about. Then either show them that you care about it too or that helping you would fit into their worldview and further that cause. As we mentioned above, finding common ground may be tough because there might not be enough information available about your target, but it’s important to do the work before you give up on this route — finding common ground is the tactic that’s going to get you the highest response rates. Here are some examples of great ways to build common ground: Reference a project they worked on (maybe they wrote a blog post about it, mentioned it in a comment on Hacker News, or are a contributor to some open source project). Then… If possible, talk about relevant work you’ve done. It’s important not to make this connection too tenuous. If you do, this approach might backfire because they’ll start to get excited about you, only to be let down and ultimately feel tricked. If you do not have relevant work to share, ask a thoughtful question or two about theirs. Reference a controversial point of view that they hold, and affirm it in an authentic way. In the absence of something technical, it’s okay to reference something non-technical you've seen on their public profiles. We've seen candidates connect with strangers based on a shared love of Star Wars or Hearthstone. We understand that you won't always be able to find common ground. But if you can, it'll help you a lot, especially if you’re light on social proof or accomplishments. Selling yourself Selling yourself is usually about one of two things: Accomplishments: What have you built or created? Social proof: Have you worked at a top company or attended a top school? Some people are fortunate enough to have both, but many will have just one. That’s okay. We’ll work with what you have! Accomplishments What have you done that most other people haven’t? What have you done that, if you were to tell it to a stranger, would cause them to pause and think you're special or interesting? Below are some examples: You’ve had a blog post about a technical topic or a personal project do well3 on Hacker News, Reddit, or social media. Something you built at work got some great press when your company announced its last funding round. You refactored a piece of code at work, and now it runs 100X faster. You won a company hackathon. You’re a core contributor to a notable open-source project. Something you built is being used by a number of other people. Social proof Social proof is more about your pedigree. If you attended a top school or worked at a company known for having a high engineering bar, you should absolutely mention it! People won't click on links or open your resume until after they're interested, so you need to get them interested right away. That is: you should spoon feed them the most impressive-sounding things about you out of the gate. This may feel strange and uncomfortable, like you’re bragging. We assure you, however, that it’s necessary to get your target’s attention. They’re not thinking you’re bragging. They’re thinking, “Is this worth my time?” Your job is to convince them that it is. Also, don’t forget to link to your LinkedIn or personal website. Attaching a resume may feel too heavy-handed for a first conversation, as we discussed above. Here's an example of a prospective intern, leveraging both social proof and accomplishments, to write a compelling email. His email isn't super personalized, but he did make some effort to say that what we do at interviewing.io is important. Formulating a strong call to action A call to action is an invitation for the recipient to do something. You can go one of two ways with your call to action: ask for a job interview or start a conversation. Which you do should be a function of how much firepower you have in the way of social proof and accomplishments. It’s not fair, but if you can get your target’s attention with one or both of those, being bold and asking for a job interview makes sense. This approach can be effective, but it won’t work for most people… because most people don’t have enough social proof or accomplishments to justify this type of request. If you can’t leverage social proof or accomplishments, you’re going to have to work harder and bank entirely on building common ground, which will likely take some time and effort and involve a live conversation before they’re convinced to expend their social capital on you. If you’re asking for an interview, just come right out and say it. You can use the intern candidate’s email from earlier as a guide. However, this isn’t our preferred way to do it, and we really recommend starting a conversation instead. Take a look at the email below. In this email, the candidate doesn’t ask me about jobs — he just asks to meet to discuss a topic. Indeed, he’s done his research. I write a ton about judging resumes, and it’s a topic I could go on about for hours if you’ll let me. His email read like he’s genuinely interested in the subject and that we’d have a good conversation, so of course I responded. You’d be surprised how rare emails like this are. If you can find the topic your target cares about and write something that shows earnest, genuine interest, they’ll respond. With these emails, you’re asking for a conversation, not a job interview… because the conversation is what will hopefully prove to the hiring manager that you’re worth interviewing. Then, once you have a conversation, the hiring manager will walk away with the impression that you’re a competent, thoughtful human being who’s interested in this sort of work. From there, getting a job interview will feel like an afterthought. As such, don’t talk about jobs at all in this type of email, and in this particular case, don’t attach your resume — that will feel out of place and transactional. You can and should link to your LinkedIn so they know who you are and have some context. But spend the bulk of the email building common ground and coming up with an interesting reason for the two of you to talk. This approach is much more effective than asking for an interview out of the gate! You’re not going to land a job from one email, so, as with any seemingly insurmountable goal, it’s important to think of your outreach as a series of steps where you put one foot in front of the other. Like in sales, all you need is to get to a conversation. If your call to action is to set up a time to talk (which it probably should be because it’s specific), we recommend providing them with a time window. \"Would you want to meet up sometime?\" puts the burden on the recipient to pose a time, while \"Can we talk next Monday at 3pm?\" is problematic because, most likely, they aren't free then. Instead, try something like the candidate above did: \"Would you be available sometime within the next two weeks for a thirty-minute call? I'm free most weekdays between X and Y and can pretty much do any time on weekends if those are better for you.\" Two templates for you to use Below are two templates you can use for cold outreach. The first one is ideal but requires more effort and can't always be used. The second one is weaker but more generic. You can choose what fits your needs best. We expect both of these templates to be far more effective than throwing your resume into the blackhole of online portals. Template #1: Use this template if your target has an online presence This template includes common ground, accomplishments/social proof, and a call to action. It will get you the highest response rates, possibly anywhere from 25-50%. However, it can be challenging to use because it requires you to 1) do a deep dive into their online presence and 2) tie what you find back to something you’re doing. Sometimes, that tie-in might be tenuous or non-existent (in which case, maybe skip it). Hey {Their First Name},I’ve read your work on {insert some details about their writing}, and I {insert your thoughts on the work}.{If you can make the connection between their work and yours, talk about something similar you’ve been working on.}{If you cannot, ask them a specific, thoughtful question about your work. Don’t worry about making it “the perfect question” like you might when you attend a talk and want to sound smart. Any earnest question will do. You don’t have to use this as a chance to show off!}{Finally, close with a sentence or two about you, if you have some social proof or impressive accomplishments you can share.}Would you be up for a quick chat this week or next?Best,{Your name} {Insert 1-2 useful links about you. If you have a personal site, that’s great. If not, a LinkedIn will do.} Note that in this template, we leave some places for you to insert some social proof and your accomplishments. Even though this email is primarily about them and their work, and your references to yourself are primarily through that lens, it never hurts to drop in a few pieces of evidence that you’re someone who’s accomplished things and/or someone who looks good on paper. Template #2: Use this template if you don’t have anything except a LinkedIn profile for your target The reality is that you won’t always have enough information about your target to find common ground. In this case, you’ll lead with accomplishments/social proof and a strong call to action. We expect this template will get you response rates anywhere from 5-25%, depending on the strength of your achievements and pedigree. That said, we recommend treating this template as a last resort. Using it means you’ve exhausted any possibility of writing something personal. Hey {Their First Name},{List 2 things about you. They can be impressive accomplishments of yours or social proof, as above.}I’m really interested in the work you’re doing at {Company Name}. {If you know what team they’re on and are interested in that specific team or are familiar with that team’s accomplishments, great! If not, just write a few earnest sentences about why the company is interesting to you.}Would you be up for a quick chat this week or next?Best,{Your name} {Insert 1-2 useful links about you. If you have a personal site, that’s great. If not, a LinkedIn will do.} Keep your note short. The intent here is to make your target believe you’re an entity worth paying attention to, rather than them doing the easy thing: deleting your email. Regardless of which template you use, just like you have to manage your psychology when you prepare for technical interviews, you have to manage your psychology when doing outreach like this. You have to: Mentally prepare yourself for the slog of writing personalized emails and doing the requisite research. Get used to rejection. If you do write good emails and target the right people, you’ll have a much better hit rate than when you apply online, but you will still get ghosted a lot, and it will sting much more because, this time, you actually tried. But you know what? If you stick with it and do this right, within a few months, you’ll have a connection to a top-tier company. Now that you’ve girded your proverbial loins, it’s time to do the work. If you follow our advice, you’ll get 1-2 orders of magnitude more responses than from applying online, and with this approach, you’ll have at least a hiring manager at that company rooting for you!

Part 1.By Aline Lerner | Published: July 24, 2024; Last updated: October 28, 2024In this post (part 1 of 2), we’ll share some data about which channels are most effective for getting into the door at great companies and why. In part 2, we get very tactical and tell you exactly what to say and do to get responses. interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform — we help engineers prepare for technical interviews by pairing them with senior FAANG and FAANG-adjacent engineers for mock interviews and feedback. In this market, many of our users are struggling with getting in the door at companies, so we ran a survey to see what’s worked well for our users and what hasn’t, in today’s difficult climate. In our survey, we gave people the following channels for getting into companies and asked them which were the most and least effective: In-house recruiters contact you Apply online Warm referrals Cold referrals Cold outreach to hiring managers Cold outreach to recruiters Agency recruiters contact you We also asked them which types of companies they got responses from: FAANG FAANG-adjacent (e.g., Stripe, Dropbox, OpenAI, Uber) Large startups Small startups We got ~500 responses. Among survey respondents, which channels were most effective was largely consistent, regardless of company type, but there were some twists depending on who the candidates were. More on that in a bit. Below are the channels, ranked by effectiveness.1 When more people found a channel effective than ineffective, it ended up in the first list. When more people found a channel to be ineffective than effective, it ended up on the second list. Recruiting channels that our users found to be effective (ranked from most to least effective): Warm referrals In-house recruiters contact you Apply online Cold outreach to hiring managers Recruiting channels that our users found to be ineffective (ranked from least to most ineffective): Cold outreach to recruiters Cold referrals (referrals from people you don’t know) Agency recruiters contact you This data came primarily from surveying experienced engineers (4+ years), rather than juniors (we don’t have that many juniors on our platform; average years of experience is 8). If you’re a junior engineer in this market, you already know you’re in for a tough time, and we’d advise you to take your destiny into your own hands as much as possible by reaching out directly to hiring managers (the same advice we give many of our more experienced users). More on that later in the post. Interestingly, these results were quite consistent between company types. In other words, channels that worked well for FAANGs tended to work well for startups and vice versa. Overall, the most useful channels were in-house recruiters (when they reached out to you) and warm referrals. Unfortunately, both of these channels are somewhat out of your control. You have very little control over whether internal recruiters reach out to you. There are some things you can do to increase the chances, but they’re all tied up in your work history and identity, neither of which you can easily change. We’ll talk more about that later on. Warm referrals (i.e., referrals from people you know), on the other hand, are very useful and are a bit more in your control, but they still depend on the quality of your network. Below is a diagram comparing the utility of all the channels to how much control you have over them. You might wonder why we speculatively singled out cold outreach to hiring managers as something that can be done right, versus the other channels. In our experience, that channel is both misused and underutilized and is the best bet for many candidates, provided they do it correctly. In our next post, we’ll tell you exactly what to do and what to say when you reach out to hiring managers — especially if you come from a non-traditional background and aren’t getting a lot of recruiter outreach/don’t have the network to get warm referrals, reaching out to hiring managers is your absolute best bet. Now let’s look at each channel in detail. In-house recruiters contact you This channel is one of the two where you have the least amount of control (the other is agency recruiters contacting you, though that one is way less useful). So, how much control do you have over this channel? One bit of analysis we did on our survey data was to try to find patterns in the background of people who find in-house recruiters particularly useful. Not too surprisingly, some patterns did emerge. In-house recruiters are most likely to contact you if: You look good on paper, i.e., you have top-tier companies and/or schools on your resume (in our experience, companies matter more) You belong to a group that’s been traditionally underrepresented in tech (i.e., you’re a woman or a person of color) To some extent, though less than the two bullets above, if you have niche skills (e.g., ML engineering) These results aren’t unique to just this survey. We recently did a study where we asked a bunch of recruiters to look at resumes and tell us which candidates they’d want to interview. While the intent of the study was to see if recruiters are good at identifying talent (spoiler: they were barely better than a coin flip), we learned some other interesting things, including what recruiters actually look for when they read a resume. The two most sought-after resume traits were: 1) experience at a top-tier tech company (FAANG or FAANG-adjacent) and 2) URM (underrepresented minority) status (in tech, this means being Black or Hispanic). This mirrored what we saw in our user survey when we looked at commonalities among candidates who got value from in-house recruiters. So how do you use this information to your advantage? You obviously can’t magic FAANG/FAANG-adjacent experience or URM status out of thin air2, but if you do have either, our pragmatic advice is to highlight it and make it really easy for recruiters to spot. Of course, whether you want to lead with URM status is a personal decision. We’ve heard differing opinions on this and are not here to judge. All we can do is share the data — do with it what you will. So, how do you make sure that, say, your FAANG experience stands out to recruiters? Take a look at the before and after screenshots of the resume below3. This resume belongs to one of our users who was kind enough to let us share it. He actually has two of the three things that recruiters look for: FAANG experience and a niche title (ML engineer). But both are buried! And the section that gets the most attention is wasted on undergraduate awards. Before As you can see, he spent almost 3 years at Apple, but a recruiter skimming his resume might not notice that because it was a while ago. Instead, he showcases an undergrad award and some technologies/languages that he knows. Neither of those is nearly as useful to recruiters as FAANG experience. His current title is also ML engineer, and one at the Principal level at that. But it wasn’t always: He went from back-end to SRE to a little bit of everything to ML, and because of that, it’s possible a recruiter would miss it as well. We edited this candidate’s resume to put all the things recruiters look for at the very top of the resume and moved the buzzword soup to the bottom. This candidate is obviously well-positioned because he has FAANG experience, several top schools, and niche skills — but before, many recruiters didn’t spot them. After he made these changes, the number of interviews he got increased by 8X. Apply online If you’ve ever applied to jobs online, then you know it’s kind of like screaming into a black hole. Though, according to our survey, some candidates (specifically people applying to FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies and small startups) get some value out of this channel, it’s still a numbers game. And for large startups, it’s a losing proposition. According to recruiting tool Gem, applicants that come from recruiter outreach (called “outbound” in recruiter lingo) are 6 - 10X more likely to get hired than applicants who apply online (called “inbound”). As Lyft recruiting manager Nate Wylie put it: Our data… showed higher pass-through rates for candidates \\[we reached out to\\] at each stage of the interview process vs. applicants via the careers page. It’s not that we want to ignore applicants; it’s just that historically we don’t get what we’re looking for — and with speed — through that channel. Having been a recruiter myself, I can confirm that many companies do indeed ignore their online careers page. Many years ago, when I first joined the recruiting team at a top-tier startup, I spent my first few days going through the resumes of people who had applied online. I found a treasure trove of candidates, including very experienced applicants from top-tier companies.4 But no one had seen these applicants because no one had been monitoring inbound activity for months! The silver lining here is that when you don’t hear back from a company (or even when you get an automatic rejection email wishing you \"the best in your future endeavors\"), it’s not because a human looked at your resume and made a deliberate, thoughtful decision about you. It’s tempting to think that way because it plays so well into our insecurities. The reality is that a human probably never saw your resume in the first place. So why do people apply online, despite knowing in their gut that it’s not an effective strategy? Simply put, it’s predictable and easy. You get into a routine, you upload your resume, you connect your LinkedIn, and you can knock out hundreds of applications in a matter of hours. The other encouraging thing about this channel is that, when we analyzed specifically which types of candidates had success with it, we couldn’t find any patterns — the channel worked equally well (poorly?) for people who looked good on paper vs. not, and there was no preferential treatment for traditionally underrepresented groups in tech (e.g., women and people of color). TL;DR Applying online doesn’t hurt… provided that you don’t take rejection personally. If you do, it’ll wear you down over time. Warm referrals Warm referrals are, of course, excellent. That is, assuming it's a real referral — someone who can actually vouch for you, and ideally your work. Per capita, referrals are most companies’ best source of candidates, and they were a great channel for our users across all company types (they were the best channel for FAANGs/FAANG-adjacents, as well as large startups, and second best for small startups, behind in-house recruiters reaching out). If you have the network, you should absolutely use it. Of course, it’s unlikely that you’ll have meaningful connections at every company you want to work at. What do you do then? Cold referrals Should you ask people you don't know to refer you? Our survey data says probably not. Cold referrals were net negative for both FAANG and small startups and neutral for large startups. Years ago, trying to collect cold referrals was a decent strategy. You could track down someone at the company and ask them to toss your proverbial hat into the ring Engineers were often happy to refer someone — even someone they didn't know — either to be kind, to avoid the awkwardness of declining, or to collect the potential referral bonus. They couldn't vouch for you, but the referral would ensure that a human looked at your resume. This became so common that Blind actually spun out an entire referral marketplace called Rooftop Slushie (the link is to some press because the actual site is now defunct), where applicants would pay a small sum for a referral. Then, companies wised up and realized that these referrals weren't all that different from normal in-bound applicants. So why treat them differently? Many companies nowadays separate referrals into \"true referrals\" and \"leads.\" It’s great for maintaining the delicate dance of social dynamics, but it’s completely useless for getting hired — dropping someone’s resume into the “leads” pile is basically the same as throwing it into the inbound black hole. Given that cold referrals aren’t zero effort, our advice is to expend that energy elsewhere. More on that shortly. Agency recruiters Agency recruiters were the worst channel overall, according to our survey, and were net negative for all company types. FAANGs and FAANG-adjacent companies tend to rely less on agencies than startups, and when they do, it’s to fill some very specific need (rather than “Hey we need more SWEs”), so it’s not surprising that our users didn’t get much value from this channel when applying to FAANGs. While both large and small startups use agencies liberally, clearly the value to candidates is limited.5 Out of all of our survey respondents, only a handful of our users said that agencies were useful to them, and of those who mentioned agencies, the majority said that they were the worst channel. We won’t belabor the point, but it’s probably not in your best interest to spend much time on working with agency recruiters. It has opportunity cost and not much upside. And you can routinely get screwed in salary negotiations when you work with an agency recruiter, if you even get that far. Cold outreach (to hiring managers vs. recruiters) Not all cold outreach is created equal, for two reasons. First, there’s your audience: hiring managers vs. recruiters. And then there’s the quality of the outreach itself. We’ll come back to how to write the kinds of messages that will get you responses. First, let’s talk about the audience. You can see in our survey results that cold outreach to hiring managers was net positive for FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies and neutral for the other company types. Cold outreach to recruiters, on the other hand, was net negative for both FAANG/FAANG-adjacents and small startups and neutral for large startups. Ignoring the quality of the outreach for a moment, which we expect is probably comparable for both types, why does this difference exist? If you had to answer the question of who’s the right person to reach out to about jobs, your gut instinct might be to say it’s recruiters. After all, hiring is officially their job! However, that’s not strictly true. Recruiters are not incentivized to make hires, at least not directly. Just like everyone else, recruiters’ main priority is to keep their jobs. Cold outreach to recruiters doesn’t work How does a recruiter keep their job?6 By bringing in the types of candidates that their manager tasked them with. How is that different from hiring? Hiring implies that you’re evaluated on whether the people you bring in actually get hired, but most in-house recruiters aren’t evaluated this way… because it takes too long. Instead, recruiters are sometimes evaluated on what portion of their candidates get offers or get to onsite. However, because of drop-off and latency (getting an offer can still take months), your organization has to be pretty good at tracking. Many are not. As such, many recruiting orgs prefer simpler, faster metrics: Of the candidates you reached out to, how many responded? Of those who responded, how many resulted in a first conversation? The downside of measuring success in a single part of the funnel is that you don’t incentivize people to care about what happens downstream (that is, how many are hired). This would be like if marketers only paid attention to ad clicks, rather than actual purchases. But that’s how recruiting operates: individuals aren’t really incentivized to care what happens downstream. So, if you are typically just measuring the response rates of your reports, as a recruiting manager, you have to set some guardrails for the types of candidates that you want your team to reach out to. If you don’t, they’ll end up just reaching out to people who are likely to respond instead of people who are a good fit for the job. Unfortunately, you don’t know who is a good fit for the job. You can’t just say, “Go on LinkedIn, and find me good engineers.” That doesn’t exist. So instead, you come up with some rules that look like this: Senior engineers Juniors and intermediate engineers would answer outreach a lot, but they already apply online in droves, so we don’t need to pay people to go out and find them. Moreover, we have a whole university department that deals with college hires once a year in September. Went to a top school (in the absence of a better filter, this works OK) Worked at a top company There may be a few other items on the list if the role requires specific skills (e.g., Android development), but by and large, that’s what recruiters are tasked with, and that’s what they’re focused on. It seems counterintuitive, but if you’re either fairly junior (fewer than 4 years of experience) or you don’t have fancy brands and schools on your resume, recruiters are not incentivized to help you because you don’t meet their criteria, and they’re not incentivized to take risks on candidates because they’re not getting rewarded when the company makes hires (or punished when the company doesn’t). What does this mean for you? If you’re not the type of candidate that recruiters are reaching out to already (senior, well-pedigreed), they will not help you. With that sad reality in mind, here’s the good news: there is someone who’s actually incentivized to make hires and is much more open-minded: the hiring manager7! Cold outreach to hiring managers is effective At this point, you might be skeptical. After all, according to the graph comparing all channels, hiring manager outreach is the worst of the best. Sure, it’s net positive for FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies, but it lags behind in-house recruiters, warm referrals, and online applications with respect to effectiveness. Here’s the thing. Hiring manager outreach is the channel with the most untapped potential for effectiveness, while also being the one where you have the most control. Because companies often ignore them, online applications can’t come close to the same level of control, and warm referrals have a low ceiling. In-house recruiter outreach is largely out of your control (except for maybe making some limited profile tweaks, as we saw above). Why is this the right channel? Unlike recruiters, hiring managers are actually incentivized to make hires and tend to be more open-minded about candidate backgrounds, all because hiring managers are judged on results. Specifically, they’re judged on how quickly and effectively they’re able to build stuff, and are — directly or indirectly — incentivized to grow headcount. For hiring managers, it’s not about the appearance of doing the work. It’s about the cold, hard reality of whether the work got done. And because they’re judged on actually getting stuff done, hiring managers are also much more incentivized than recruiters to take risks. Outside of needing more people to build things, hiring managers are also incentivized to hire for their teams because the better they are at recruiting and filling headcount, the more likely they are to get promoted. As such, in our minds, when people say that hiring manager outreach hasn’t worked for them, it’s because they’re not doing it right. So, how do you do it? In our next post, we’ll get very practical about outreach, provide a bunch of examples of good and bad outreach, and share two templates that you can steal. Footnotes: Footnotes First, here’s how we got to these rankings. We asked each engineer who took our survey to rank all the channels they used to get in the door, from best to worst. Then we tallied up the points (+1 for best two channels, -1 for worst two). We didn’t do a more granular point system (e.g., +2 and -2) because the difference between the top two channels wasn’t always 2X, and generally, from talking to our users, preferences were somewhat muddy. As such, these results are directionally correct, but we didn’t feel comfortable numerically comparing them to one another. Finally, we divided the total tally by the number of times that channel came up. As a result, we were able to rank channels from most effective to least effective. ↩ This is why I generally view resume writers as selling snake oil. Either you have the things recruiters are looking for or you don’t. If you don’t, no amount of wordsmithing your bullet points or reorganizing the page is going to make a significant difference. Sure, check your resume for typos, and make sure that it reads decently well. Any more time invested in your resume after those basic things will have diminishing returns. Beware of anyone who tells you otherwise, and beware of any products or services who charge for resume review. ↩ We realize that recruiters won’t always have access to your resume when doing outreach and are likely looking at your LinkedIn instead. The same advice stands. Make sure that your About section has all the most important tidbits about you, front and center. Also, even though we didn’t see the same strong preference for FAANGs and URM status when applying online (more on that in the next section), making these types of changes to your resume certainly won’t hurt. ↩ Of course we don’t share the point of view that you can only be a good candidate if you have a brand-name company on your resume. However, many recruiters do, and they are still ignoring this channel. ↩ We’d argue that the value to companies is limited as well. Though there are a handful of excellent agency recruiters out there, most are terrible. The hard thing is that, as an employer, you can’t immediately tell who’s terrible, and you end up wasting a bunch of time reviewing profiles of candidates who might look promising on the surface, but because of selection bias (these are the people who decided to work with bad agency recruiters, after all) are not a fit. That or they’re not interested in your company (and have possibly never even opted in to talk to you) or both. ↩ At larger companies, recruiting is usually split into two functions: sourcing (these are the people who reach out to candidates) and recruiting (these are the people who manage candidates’ journey through the process and extend offers). In this post, for simplicity, we’re lumping them together because separating them out would change some of the details but wouldn’t change the key takeaways. ↩ Note that if you’re interested in smaller startups (Series A and below), you can substitute “founder” for “hiring manager” in the steps below. Founders are the most incentivized to get shit done and take risks, regardless of company size and stage, but at larger startups, they may be less likely to read cold emails because they get bombarded with all manners of requests and sales pitches. At a Series B or C company or at public companies with fewer than, say, 3000 employees, in addition to hiring managers, you should also target Directors and VPs — they have the power to get things done and aren’t so far removed from feeling the pain of not filling roles that making an extra hire or two is out of their purview. At large public companies, targeting Directors and above doesn’t make much sense — they ARE too far removed from doing the work to make individual hires. If you do contact them, the best outcome is that they’ll pass you on to one of their direct reports. ↩ Life is chaos and pain.

Take-home assignments could, in theory, be great for both companies and candidates. What better, fairer way to evaluate someone’s ability to do the work… than to have them do the work? Unfortunately, in practice, take-homes typically suck for engineers. We surveyed almost 700 of our users about their experiences with take-homes and interviewed a handful more for deeper insights. We learned a lot—mostly about candidates' poor experiences and negative feelings toward take-homes. They take a lot of time. They don’t respect candidates’ time. Candidates often get no feedback. And candidates are almost never compensated. The good news? Turns out there are some pretty simple things companies can do to vastly improve their take-home assignments. But before we dive into that… Why do companies use take-home assignments? Take-homes vary a ton by role and company in terms of the types of questions, subject matter, length, and intensity. At their simplest, take-homes can be the same questions as in an algorithmic interview, except done asynchronously. The other extreme is asking candidates to build an entire app and deploy it. We were surprised to see how often companies use take-homes. About 85% of our users got one at some point in their career, independent of their experience level. Of the users who encountered them, they tended to see them as part of the process about 20% of the time, again, independent of their experience level1. Why are take-homes relatively popular among employers? They mostly use them to save time in the hiring process. There are, however, some more noble reasons a company might use a take-home assignment: Get better signal during the interview process, as a take-home can be more indicative of actual work Get a candidate's best work out of them in a lower-stress environment than a live algorithmic interview and/or attract candidates who don’t like algorithmic interviews (of which there are plenty) Broaden the candidate pool by offering a way in for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds—in lieu of a resume screen, which they’d likely fail, candidates can do choose to do an assignment Accordingly, here’s the relevant part of a great conversation between Vincent Woo of CoderPad and Patrick McKenzie (known to Hacker News folks as patio11) of Stripe, formerly of Starfighter. Vincent: What general sort of high level change do you think that recruiters at tech companies that are roughly Stripe’s size or bigger ought to make? Patrick: If I could wave a magic wand and sell the world on one concept, it would be selling the world on the desirability of work sample testing… where the way to tell if someone is good at something is to have them do the something. Despite enthusiasm for the theory of take-homes and some very well-intentioned reasons, candidates overwhelmingly don’t like take-homes. Here’s why. Why don’t candidates like take-homes? It’s about value asymmetry. Though users expressed a lot of frustration with take-homes, we were surprised to see very few take a hard-line stance and refuse to do them. Only 6% outright refuse, and 66% of people complete take-homes all or most of the time. Surprisingly, these stats didn’t really change when we looked only at senior engineers. I was expecting that experienced engineers would do them almost never, if at all, but that’s not what the data shows. It’s possible that seniors are just louder in their disapproval. Nevertheless, the more desirable a company, the more likely candidates will do the take-home and feel OK about it—70% told us they completed them because they “Really wanted to work at the company and were willing to do what it took.” I found Weedmaps \\[to be\\] a very interesting company. They were the first marijuana related company to IPO. So you'd be on the frontier working for them. I found that exciting. So I applied and they had \\[a\\] take-home. I was like, sure, of course I’ll do this. Other reasons our users gave for completion included: “Because the take-home would be discussed at the onsite” (38%) and “Interesting/cool assignment” (37%). However, many of those who did finish them had such a poor experience that they said they’d never apply to certain companies ever again. We’ll talk about what makes the experience poor in a little bit. Of the people who refused to do at least one take-home at some point in their career, here were their reasons. Numbers don’t add up to 100 because it was a multi-select poll. In addition, we obviously don’t know how often take-homes are boring or unclear in the wild (probably often!), nor do we know how often companies pay people to do them (our guess, based on some napkin math, is >10% of the time). So we don’t have the true denominator for these stats. Nevertheless, we found these results insightful. The common thread among all of these reasons is value asymmetry. The worst take-homes feel unrewarding to candidates. Even exploitative. Take-home assignments ask a lot of candidates: a significant investment of their time, with an often unclear scope, no guarantee of progressing to the next round, often without feedback, and almost always without compensation. Meanwhile, the company has basically invested nothing, except to send the task. We heard this a lot. When I'm interviewing, I look for things that are proxies for valuing team members… or not. If they want me to do a take-home test, and they haven't even spent 30 minutes on a phone screen, I begin to sense an asymmetry in our relationship, with their time and resources being very valuable, and mine not being valuable at all. A divergence between how much effort they want me to put in, and how much they want to put in themselves. It signals that they are more worried about their time than mine, their costs than mine. It also means they underestimate how much effort it takes to write code, so that if I go to work for them, I am likely to face demands to work uncompensated overtime to meet their optimistic estimates. Spending five hours on their one-hour test for nothing leaves hard feelings. And if they ghost me after the test, I will happily tell every developer who asks what cheapskates they are. Is there any relationship between who candidates are and their willingness to do take-homes? Perhaps surprisingly, our data says no. We ran a regression to compare our survey respondents’ interview performance on our platform to how likely they were to do take-homes. The relationship was so weak as to be negligible. Similarly, we ran a regression to see if people who look good on paper are more or less likely to do take-homes. The relationship there was negligible as well. In other words, contrary to some popular opinions, you’re not necessarily weeding out your best candidates by doing take-homes, whether you define “best” in terms of how their resume looks or how they perform in interviews. How companies can make take-homes better (and why they probably should) After reading the stats above, you might think that, despite their grumblings, candidates generally do take-homes, and the best candidates won’t be weeded out. So, if you’re one of the many companies that uses them, it may not make sense to invest your limited time into making them better. It’s not that simple. For some companies, like the FAANGs, who have extremely strong brands and are known to pay well, changes are probably not worth it, especially in this market, where junior and senior engineers are willing to jump through more hoops than ever before. If you’re not a FAANG, though, listen up. Here are some questions you can ask yourself to figure out if you should indeed make some changes to your take-homes. First, take an honest look in the mirror and ask yourself about your brand strength. Are you a household name? Does having you on candidates’ resumes give them automatic prestige? Are you known to pay above market? If the answer to all of these questions isn’t a resounding yes, your brand strength is probably not strong enough to make people jump through hoops. Here’s a sketch to drive that point home. Unless you have a ton of brand strength, candidates’ willingness to jump through hoops drops off sharply. In fairness, I drew this sketch in a boom market. Maybe it’s a bit less steep now, but honestly, I’m not sure. If you aren’t maxing out on brand strength, there are two questions you should ask yourself: What is my take-home completion rate? What is my offer acceptance rate? If your completion rate is below, say, 60% (our data shows that candidates complete take-homes around 62% of the time), then it’s DEFINITELY time to make a change. Honestly, regardless of what our data says, if people aren’t completing them at least 85% of the time, it’s probably time to make a change—losing more than 15% of your candidates to attrition at any given stage in the funnel is bad. What about your offer acceptance rate? If it’s less than 50% and you’re using a take-home already, there’s an opportunity to make some improvements. You might be wondering what this has to do with take-homes in the first place. To answer that, let’s change how we think about different parts of the interview process. At face value, every part of the process is there to vet candidates, to determine if they’re the right fit for your organization. However, when used correctly, every part of your process should become a selling vehicle as well. This is especially important for companies who do not have a strong, well-known brand. The FAANGs can get away with using their interview processes primarily as vetting exercises because candidates are already sold on the pay or prestige or sometimes on the work and the product. When you don’t have an established brand, the candidates who come to you are, at best, open to learning more, and the interview process is the instrument that teaches them. Wield it accordingly. Though we strongly advocate coming up with great, unique interview questions2 and making sure you have great interviewers, if your process does have a take-home component, it is one of the more overlooked parts of the process when it comes to selling. You have the opportunity to have someone do the actual work that you do! This is your chance to pick the coolest stuff you’ve worked on and serve it up to someone on a platter and make it stick in their brains and make them imagine what it’d be like to work on these kinds of problems every day! Why wouldn’t you jump at this opportunity? You may think you don’t need to sell in this market. But just because employers have all the power right now, it doesn’t mean that will always be the case. And great senior engineers still have a lot of leverage. If, after considering your take-home completion rate and your offer acceptance rate, it looks like you do need to make some changes, here are some practical tips, based on what we’ve learned from talking to our users (overwhelmingly senior engineers who are targeting top-tier companies—probably the people you want). Let’s start with what we just talked about: using the take-home as a selling vehicle. Make them interesting and relevant to the actual work You're getting a chance to spend a couple of hours with somebody in a take-home (metaphorically). Why wouldn't you do everything you can to get them excited? Pick a problem that you've worked on, and get them hooked on it. Pick the kernel of an interesting problem that you've solved, and build something around it that will challenge candidates. Something that gets them thinking, “I could have done that better” or “This is a different or more efficient way to do it.” That's going to be more effective than the standard perks many companies offer. \\[Best take-home I’ve seen was an\\] open-ended system design question on the type of system I would work on, was meant to simulate a team discussion on the system we needed to build, and was a great way for me to start thinking about what I'd be working on there. One way you could do this, is to have your engineering team keep a shared doc of ‘cool’ solutions they've found, or new things they've tried. These can serve as jumping-off points for creating your take-homes. The… challenge was for an internal tooling team that specialized in incident response tools; their challenge was to create a scaled down version of a tool already in use at the company. The focus was more on understanding the domain and customer than wiring up a bunch of complicated stuff, and it was a delight. It being a greenfield also gave you an opportunity to showcase some software design skills. I did not get this job, but enjoyed the experience and still feel connected to the team. It was conceptually related to the sort of work the team was performing, but it was simplified and stand-alone enough to clearly not be unpaid labor for their product. Just be sure that when you come up with a practical problem that you strip out the annoying parts and focus only on the juicy kernel of the problem, the part that’s actually cool and lets the candidate be smart and creative. Don’t make them do grunt work or wrestle with their dev environment! \\[This\\] was for a tooling team in Support, where they didn't have a lot of experience creating challenges or interviewing. One of the engineers took a difficult task that he had accomplished recently and just made that the take home challenge. It involved a lot of Ruby version conflict debugging. It was completely demoralizing and felt like hazing. Keep them short Candidates overwhelmingly favor take-homes that respect their time, i.e., short ones. The best were short and brief, took no more than 2 hours and were directly related to what I would be doing on the job. Best are realistic and time bound, i.e., low time investment required. Short and quick take-homes are great. Over 80% of survey respondents said that take-homes should take 4 hours or less, and a plurality thought that they should take 2 hours. The outliers are interesting. Unfortunately, we missed an opportunity to ask about those in the survey. Take-homes being short in theory is one thing… but we got a lot of feedback that take-homes often go far beyond how long companies tell candidates that take-homes should take. Have someone on your team QA the actual length of the assignment This disconnect between actual time and expected time is another instance of value asymmetry: companies didn't even bother to have someone on their team do the take-home themselves and time it. I've done a couple of algorithm questions as take-homes that the interviewer said should take an hour. They routinely take longer than that. Companies will say, ‘don’t spend more than X hours on it,’ but then it actually takes 5X that amount. It's just too much time. And most of the time they didn’t give feedback at all even though I spent so much time on it. Companies should clearly communicate the expected time commitment for a take-home. And they should be realistic about how much time it should take. Best was an interesting problem with a realistic time frame. They estimated 2 hours and it took me exactly that, which was refreshing and made the process seem fair. I've done a couple of exercises where they were truly respectful of my time. The tasks were small, clearly defined, and they gave me a realistic timeframe to complete them. For the best take-home I did, the company told me: ‘Tell us when you're going to start, and you'll have 4 hours. We'll be available over email that whole time, and we'll answer your questions within minutes.’ That felt respectful of my time, and was a more reliable signal of my capabilities than a 20-minute algorithms exercise. To get a realistic estimate, companies could simply QA their own take-homes—just by having someone on your team take it, and time them. Still, some candidates will spend more time anyway, because they really want to work for a certain company. And it can be easy for candidates to go down a rabbit hole and get most of a take-home done in the first few hours, then spend another day or more, perfecting it to give themselves a better chance. Do you want me to literally only work two hours on something that's clearly going to take 10 to really be able to have a conversation with you about how I think about things? Because two hours of decisions isn't as good as 10 hours of decisions. It’s okay if candidates want to put in extra time, but it should be made clear that that's not the expectation. Set a clear scope, related to the role The scope was poorly defined, which made the assignment not only tedious, but also seemed like a waste of time. Having clear, straightforward instructions can significantly enhance the take-home experience for candidates, making them feel purposeful and relevant. The best take-homes are those that directly align with the actual job. When candidates are asked to solve a simplified version of a real problem your company is facing, it not only tests relevant skills, but also gives a candidate insight into what work at your company would be like, which is really what selling is. (This is, of course, assuming that you believe what you’re working on is cool… If you don’t, how will you ever convince others?) One was a great learning experience because I had to solve a problem similar to what I would face in the job. It was concise and focused. Being able to ask questions before or during the take-home, e.g., having a direct contact point who’s an engineer at the company, can also be a big plus. Be thoughtful about where in your process you insert the take-home, and give candidates a choice between a take-home and something else For take-homes early in the process, before speaking to a human We expect that many of the companies reading this piece have take-homes as the first step in their process, before ever talking to a human. This decision isn’t very popular. If a company calls me for a screening interview, it means they've read my resume and cover letter, and not immediately dismissed my application as inappropriate. It also means they're putting a person on a phone call with me for the duration of the screening interview. This is symmetric, my effort matches theirs. \\[I\\] did a take home that was automatically sent to me after applying, before even speaking to a human. The feedback was 'you are too expensive,' no feedback on the coding. Company needs to build an investment with the candidate first—they shouldn't ask for it before meeting the candidate at least once. That said, take-homes can be a great way to let candidates who don’t look good on paper show what they can do, and those candidates are more likely to complete them. To prevent candidate unhappiness/attrition, give them a choice. Either submit a resume or do the take-home assignment or both. If you go this route, though, design a take-home that you trust. We’ve seen companies take this approach and then throw out perfect-scoring take-homes when they didn’t like the resume. If you use a take-home, then respect your candidates enough to follow up with the ones who’ve done well, even if they don’t look good on paper. For take-homes later in the process Another way to make take-homes purposeful is to give your candidates an explicit choice about whether they’d rather do a technical interview or a take-home. Engineers are, in fact, split on which they’d prefer. Giving them a choice allows them to showcase their skills in the format they prefer and feel best prepared for. If you have good questions, you should be able to get good signal from either. Only 10% of respondents told us that they were given the choice of take-home versus technical interview. So there is an opportunity for more companies to do this. It's a candidate-friendly gesture that shows empathy and can help candidates shine. Many candidates have spent months preparing for standard technical interviews. So it can feel anticlimactic when they find out that a company they're excited about doesn't do them. Others get so nervous in a live interview that they don’t perform. I rarely don't pass take-home assessments, but I often fail to pass live interviews. Interestingly, one user we interviewed told us that they spend far less time on a take-home compared to preparing for a live technical interview. And because of that they prefer take-homes. I prefer take-homes over all other assessments because I find I spend far less time on take-homes then I do preparing for live interviews. It's hard to overestimate the amount of extra time I spend preparing for a technical interview, compared to doing a take-home—for me it’s maybe 10 times as much. I've spent hundreds of hours, maybe 500 hours, over the course of my career preparing for technical interviews. And if I have one pop up, I can't just drop everything and do it right away. I have to spend a lot of extra time just ramping up for a particular interview, in addition to the hundreds of hours that I've done. Give candidates a good, rational reason to do the take-home Clear communication about the purpose of a take-home in the hiring process, as well as why it’s rational to spend time on it, is important for candidates. It’s a way to make sure it feels purposeful and not like a random task. One way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to replace some parts of your process with it. A standard process without a take-home has a recruiter call followed by a technical phone screen followed by an onsite (virtual or otherwise). The technical phone screen usually lasts about an hour. The onsite usually lasts 6 hours. Let’s say your take-home takes 2 hours to do. You can make it replace the phone screen and one of the onsite rounds, which nets out to the same number of hours spent. If you go this route, we recommend doing the math explicitly for candidates and showing them that the time they spend on the take-home is equivalent to the time they’d be spending on a process without it. Another way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to incorporate it into the onsite, where at least one of the rounds, if not more, will include a code review and/or thoughtful discussion about tradeoffs and choices made. This should be standard practice, but isn’t always. 32% of our users said companies had told them this, and it was the reason they decided to do a take-home. The best take-homes were ones that we discussed in the first rounds of interviews. The worst ones were ones that I submitted and we never talked about them again. Ideally, you do both of these things together, and very clearly explain to candidates both the math and how the take-home informs the content of the onsite. Compensate candidates Probably the most striking result of our survey was that 58% of candidates think that they deserve compensation for completing take-homes. Yet only 4% reported ever receiving it. Compensation can shift candidate perceptions of the hiring process and of the company: They compensated me for my time, which made the process feel very professional and respectful. It was a completely open source codebase and so their process was the exact same as someone that was an employee: here's the ticket with the information to do it, set up the environment, download all the code, get everything running. They gave me a few different tasks I could choose from, I could pick two, and if I completed them I would be compensated a fixed rate, which was $100 for each task. Which in terms of the time I spent on it, is still really cheap for them. If candidates know they’re going to be paid for their work on a take-home, they’ll be more likely to complete it as well. Compensating candidates is a clear gesture that shows you value their time and effort, that there’s more symmetry in the relationship. It also goes hand-in-hand with time: paying also forces a company to scope the take-home to a reasonable number of hours. So it's a forcing function for good behavior—if you can’t afford much, then don't make the take-home too long! How much to pay? Responses about how much companies should pay for take-home assignments were split. Fixed amounts: Just over half of respondents (52%) suggested specific and reasonable fixed amounts, ranging from $50 to $500. Hourly rates: The other almost half (47%) favored an hourly rate, with suggestions ranging from $50 an hour and upward (average of $217 an hour). Some suggested that the rate should correspond to the salary of the position being applied for, or be comparable to what an employee at that level and company would earn. As one user put it: Maybe just pay market? One antipattern when it comes to comp is NOT having a set rate, asking the candidate to name their price, and thereby putting the candidate in a position where they feel like they need to negotiate. In this scenario, the candidate has to negotiate twice: once on the take-home and once on their actual comp, with the worry that negotiating too aggressively on the take-home might count them out… or not aggressively enough anchoring the company to lower compensation down the line. No one needs these mind-games in an already stressful process. Just have a set rate, for god’s sake. Symbolic compensation: This is probably not the best option, but a handful of survey respondents (1%) did mention that a minimal symbolic compensation would do. While 1% is small, we found this interesting to include because, when we interviewed people, two of them mentioned this. I think any compensation at all has symbolic value. A $100 Amazon card would impress me. A $50 Amazon card and a company t-shirt would at least not insult me. It’s kind of a consolation prize to say, ‘No hard feelings.’ I feel like a couple meal vouchers would do it these days. Of these options, we’d recommend a reasonable fixed amount based on the task, and the actual time it’s supposed to take. And of course you know how long it takes because you had one of your engineers do it themselves, right? Right?? Give feedback Lack of feedback was the primary reason our survey respondents said their experience with a given company was bad. Regardless of interview type, we’re always pro feedback, but feedback is especially important for take-homes, because in a way they ask more of a candidate. Offering constructive feedback, regardless of the hiring decision, respects the candidate's effort on the take-home. Despite the time and effort they invested in completing take-homes, many of our survey respondents said they received no feedback at all. This was seen as demoralizing, and it deterred candidates from applying to future opportunities at those companies. Getting rejected without having a chance to discuss the code with anyone is a terrible experience. It is really discouraging spending a large amount of time to find out you are rejected without explanations. They provided no feedback after submission, which made the whole effort feel unappreciated and one-sided. Incidentally, the main reason companies don’t give feedback is fear of getting sued. As it turns out, literally ZERO companies (at least in the US) have ever been sued by an engineer who received constructive post-interview feedback. Thanks to Dan Fennessy for all the behind-the-scenes work on this post.

Here's the data.By Aline Lerner and Peter Bergman | Published: May 1, 2024; Last updated: May 20, 2024This post is a very exciting first for interviewing.io because it’s about a proper experiment run by a real, live academic research lab. If you’ve been reading my work for the past decade, you know that I’ve always been something of an armchair researcher. I ran some experiments before starting interviewing.io, and since then, my team and I have kept it up. One of the experiments I ran before I founded interviewing.io was an attempt to figure out how good recruiters were at judging candidate quality based on resumes. I ran it 10 years ago and discovered that not only was everyone bad at judging resumes (about as accurate as flipping a coin), they all disagreed with each other about what a good candidate looked like. Even though these results were shocking at the time, the study had some serious limitations. First, I had no objective measures for which candidates were actually good. I was working as a recruiter at the time, so I knew whom I had been able to place, but that’s obviously not the be-all and end-all of engineering ability. Second, I had a non-representative sample of software engineers. Due to my brand, I had managed to attract a lot of excellent, non-traditional candidates — engineers who were actually very good but didn’t look good on paper. These types of resumes are the hardest for recruiters to judge, and the data was full of them. Finally, my sample size wasn’t that big: I ended up with 716 data points in total, only about half of which came from recruiters (the rest came from engineers and hiring managers — my original hypothesis was that they might be better at the task, but I was wrong… everyone was bad at judging resumes). So, now that I’m CEO of interviewing.io, with access to a lot more data, resources, and a team of excellent academics at Learning Collider, we decided to run this study again, but with a more rigorous treatment and better conditions, to see if we could replicate the results. This time, we focused just on recruiters, given that they’re most often the gatekeepers who decide which candidates get an interview. Below are all the details, but here’s the TL;DR: we reproduced my results from 10 years ago! Our new study showed that recruiters were only a bit better than a coin flip at making value judgments, and they still all disagreed with each other about what a good candidate looks like. In this piece, we also talk about: How far off recruiters were in their predictions and how much they disagreed with each other What recruiters say they look for vs. what the data shows they actually look for Why recruiters taking more time to parse resumes would lead to better outcomes (median parse time is just 31 seconds) Whether AI can do a better job at judging resumes (spoiler: yes, it can) The rest of this piece is co-authored by Peter Bergman, Tushar Kundu, and Kadeem Noray of Learning Collider. The setup In the real world, resumes (or LinkedIn profiles) are evaluated by recruiters in minutes — even seconds — and these evaluations are THE thing that determines who gets an interview. But what do these word walls tell recruiters? How predictive are their evaluations of actual interview success? Ultimately, how good are recruiters at judging resumes? To answer these questions, we designed a study approximating technical recruiters’ decisions in the real world. We asked1 76 technical recruiters (both agency and in-house) to review and make judgments about 30 engineers’ resumes each, just as they would in their current roles. They answered two questions per resume: Would you interview this candidate?2 (Yes or No) What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview (as a percentage)? We ended up with nearly 2,200 evaluations of over 1,000 resumes. The resumes in this study belonged to interviewing.io users (with their consent) — actual engineers currently on the job market. Collaborating on this study with interviewing.io is an ideal scenario, precisely because outcome data were available for comparison purposes. Each engineer in this study has completed multiple mock interviews on the platform. Performance in these interviews is quite predictive of performance in real interviews: top performers (roughly the top 5% of users) on interviewing.io are 3X more likely to pass technical interviews at top-tier companies than candidates from other sources. Even passing a single interview on interviewing.io is a strong predictor of outcomes; it's associated with a 32% increase in the chance of working at a FAANG company post-interview. Once we had recruiters’ evaluations of the resumes, we compared them to how those engineers actually performed on interviewing.io: skills scores, feedback from interviewers, and ultimately, whether they passed or failed their mock interviews. Recruiters’ resume judgments are just slightly better than a coin flip Question #1: Would you interview this candidate? In aggregate, recruiters in the study recommended 62% of candidates for an interview. But how did recruiter evaluations stack up against candidates’ performance on the platform? We calculated recruiter accuracy by treating each candidate’s first interview (pass/fail) as the truth, and recruiters’ decision to interview as a prediction. It turns out that recruiters chose correctly 55% of the time, which is just slightly better than a coin flip. Question #2: What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview? Recruiters predicted the likelihood that each candidate would pass the technical interview. In most hiring processes, the technical interview follows the recruiter call and determines whether candidates proceed to the onsite. Being able to accurately predict which candidates will succeed at this stage is important and should inform the decision about whether to interview the candidate or not. What we found most surprising is how far their predictions were from the truth: When recruiters predicted the lowest probability of passing (0-5%), those candidates actually passed the technical interview with a 47% probability. When recruiters predicted the highest probability of passing (95-100%), those candidates actually passed with a 64% probability. Below is a graph that shows recruiter predictions vs. actual performance. The x-axis is the bucketed recruiter rating. In other words, the first point is all the candidates that recruiters assigned a 0-5% likelihood of passing. The y-axis is the average interviewing.io pass rate for those candidates. The red dotted line represents 100% accuracy – in an ideal world, the higher a recruiter's ranking of a candidate, the higher their actual performance would be. The orange line represents reality – as you can see, there isn’t much correspondence between how recruiters predicted candidates would perform and their actual performance. Recruiters’ predictions below 40% underestimate these candidates by an average of 23 percentage points. Above 60%, they’re overestimating by an average of 20 percentage points. If this was predicting student performance, recruiters would be off by two full letter grades. Recruiters can’t agree on what a good candidate looks like Clearly, there is lots of noise in resume evaluations. Were recruiters’ noisy judgments at least consistent when reviewing the same resumes? Nearly 500 resumes were evaluated by more than one recruiter. Based on a random selection of two evaluations per resume, the overall likelihood of two recruiters agreeing to either interview or not interview a given candidate was 64%. Since recruiters also guess the probability a candidate will pass the technical interview, we can compare how different these guesses are for a given candidate. The average differential between two randomly selected recruiters’ evaluations of the same resume was 41 percentage points. So, let’s say one recruiter predicts a 30% probability the candidate would pass; another recruiter evaluating the same resume would predict, on average, a 71% probability of passing. To further understand just how prevalent the disagreement is, we looked at the standard deviations for across-candidate evaluations and same-candidate evaluations: 0.34 across different candidates 0.32 across the same candidates So, when two recruiters are asked to judge the same candidate, their level of disagreement is nearly the same as if they evaluated two completely different candidates. The most sought-after resume attributes Despite the noise and variability in the study’s resume evaluations, there were some characteristics that recruiters consistently favored: experience at a top-tier tech3 company (FAANG or FAANG-adjacent) and URM (underrepresented minority) status (in tech, this means being Black or Hispanic). Most predictive for Question #1 (whether a recruiter would want to interview that candidate) was experience at a top company — these candidates were 35% more likely to be picked. Black or Hispanic candidates are also associated with an increased likelihood a recruiter would interview a candidate — by 21%.4 With Question #2 (how likely the candidate was to pass a technical interview), having a top company on your resume is associated with a 21% increase in the likelihood that recruiters believe the candidate will pass the interview. Compared to the actual pass rates, recruiters’ predictions of FAANG candidates are generally accurate (average 4 percentage point overestimate).5 Unlike the presence of a top company, URM status didn't appear to influence recruiter decisions here. How do recruiters’ stated reasons for rejecting candidates line up with actual rejection reasons? So, we know what recruiters tend to favor, whether they’d admit to it or not: 1) FAANG/FAANG-adjacent experience and 2) URM status. But what’s even more interesting than why a recruiter would say yes is why they would say no. When we asked recruiters to judge a resume, we also asked them WHY they made that decision.6 Below are recruiters’ stated reasons for rejecting candidates. As you can see, “missing skill” is the main reason by far, with “no top firm” a distant third. So, then, we wondered… How do recruiters’ stated reasons for rejecting candidates line up with reality? To figure that out, we analyzed the resumes that ended up in the rejected pile and looked at common traits. Below is a graph of actual rejection reasons, based on our analysis. The main rejection reason isn’t “missing skill” — it’s “no top firm.” This is followed, somewhat surprisingly, but much less reliably (note the huge error bars), by having an MBA. “No top school” and having a Master’s degree come in at third and fourth. Note that these top four rejection reasons are all based on a candidate’s background, NOT their skill set. The y-axis is the coefficient from regressing rejection on that variable. So, a coefficient of Y for a given trait means that trait is associated with a Y\\*100% percentage point increase in the likelihood of being rejected. Slowing down is associated with better decisions Another key piece of this study is time. In hiring settings, recruiters make decisions quickly. Moving stacks of candidates through the funnel gives little room to second-guess or even wait before determining whether or not to give a candidate the opportunity to interview. In our study, the median time spent on resume evaluations was just 31 seconds. Broken down further by Question #1 — whether or not the recruiter would interview them — the median time spent was: 25 seconds for those advanced to a technical interview 44 seconds for those placed in the reject pile Given the weight placed on single variables (e.g., experience at a top firm), how quickly recruiters make judgments isn’t surprising. But might they be more accurate if they slowed down? It turns out that spending more time on resume evaluations, notably >45 seconds, is associated with more accurate predictions — just spending 15 more seconds appears to increase accuracy by 34%.7 It could be that encouraging recruiters to slow down might result in more accurate resume screening. Can AI do better? As a gaggle of technologists and data geeks, we tested whether algorithms could quiet the noise and inconsistencies in recruiters’ predictions. We trained two local, off-the-rack machine-learning models.8 Just like human recruiters, the models were trained to predict which candidates would pass technical interviews. The training dataset was drawn from interviewing.io and included anonymized resume data (years of experience, whether they had worked at a top firm, and whether they had attended a top 10 school for either grad or undergrad), candidates’ race and gender, and interview outcomes.9 Despite the very limited types of data we input into both models, when presented with out-of-sample candidate profiles, both models made predictions more accurately than human recruiters. Random Forest was somewhat more accurate than recruiters when predicting lower performing candidates. XGBoost, however, was more accurate across the board than both the Random Forest model AND recruiters. Where does this leave us? In this section, when we say “we,” we are speaking as interviewing.io, not as the researchers involved in this study. Just FYI. Advice for candidates At interviewing.io, we routinely get requests from our users to add resume review to our list of offerings. So far, we have declined to build it. Why? Because we suspected that recruiters, regardless of what they say publicly, primarily hunt for name brands on your resume. Therefore, highlighting your skills or acquiring new skills is unlikely to make a big difference in your outcomes. We are sad to see the numbers back up our intuition that it mostly is about brands.10 As such, here’s an actionable piece of advice: maintain a healthy skepticism when recruiters advise you to grow your skill set. Acquiring new skills will very likely make you a better engineer. But it will very likely NOT increase your marketability. If enhancing your skill set won’t help, what can you do to get in front of companies? We’re in the midst of a brutal market, the likes of which we haven’t seen since the dot-com crash in 2000. According to anecdotes shared in our Discord community, even engineering managers from FAANGs are getting something like a 10% response rate when they apply to companies online. If that’s true, what chance do the rest of us have? We strongly encourage anyone looking for work in this market, especially if you come from a non-traditional background, to stop spending energy on applying online, full stop. Instead, reach out to hiring managers. The numbers will be on your side there, as relatively few candidates are targeting hiring managers directly. We plan to write a full blog post on how to do this kind of outreach well, but this CliffsNotes version will get you started: Get a LinkedIn Sales Navigator account Make a target list of hiring managers at the companies you’re interested in Figure out their emails (you can use a tool like RocketReach), and send them something short and personalized. Do not use LinkedIn. The same way that you don’t live in LinkedIn, eng managers don’t either. Talk about the most impressive thing you’ve built. Ask them about their work, if you can find a blog post they’ve written or a project they’ve worked on publicly. Tie those two things together, and you’ll see a much higher response rate. Writing these personalized emails takes time, of course, but in this market, it’s what you need to do to stand out. Advice for recruiters We know that recruiting is a tough job, especially in the current climate, where there are more applicants than ever and fewer recruiters to parse through them. So, it rationally makes sense to us that a recruiter would spend no more than 30 seconds per resume and focus primarily on looking for top brands. We hope, though, that this piece may have given a measure of pause about your approach, and we’d like to leave you with two actionable pieces of advice. First, if you do nothing else, please slow down. As you saw above, taking just 15 extra seconds to read a resume could improve your accuracy by 34%.11 Our second piece of advice is this. Freada Kapor Klein from Kapor Capital coined the term “distance traveled” more than two decades ago. It refers to what someone accomplished, in the context of where they started. For instance, Kapor Klein recommends that, in their admissions processes, universities should consider not just the number of AP tests a candidate has passed but the number of AP tests divided by the total number offered at their high school. For example, if an applicant took 5 AP tests and their school offered 27, that paints a very different picture from another applicant who also took 5 AP tests when that’s the total number offered at their school. Kapor Capital uses distance traveled as one of their metrics for determining which entrepreneurs to fund. One can easily apply this concept to hiring as well. Take a look at the resume below. \"John\" (name has been changed; scrubbed resume shared with permission) studied chemical engineering and worked his way into software engineering by starting as a service engineer focused on pen testing. In the meantime, he completed a bootcamp, attended the Bradfield School of Computer Science (a school dedicated to teaching computer science at a depth beyond what many university programs, and certainly most bootcamps, offer), and ended up with a senior title in just three years. John was consistently rated poorly by recruiters but is one of the top performers on interviewing.io. It takes just a bit more time, so please spend a little longer reading resumes, and evaluate candidates’ achievements in the context of where they came from. Think about the denominator. But don’t think for a moment that we recommend that you lower the bar — absolutely not. On interviewing.io, we regularly see candidates like John objectively outperforming their FAANG counterparts. What this means for our industry The last time I did this research, I wrote about how being bad at judging resumes isn’t anything to be ashamed about and that comes down to the resume itself being a low-signal and not-very-useful document. I held that same opinion for the last decade (and even wrote a recent post about how AI can’t do recruiting)… right up until we ran this study and successfully built two ML models that outperformed recruiters. So, I stand corrected. As you saw above, both models were limited – they were looking at the same types of features that recruiters do when they quickly scan a resume, certainly fewer features than recruiters have access to. But, despite that, the AI models still outperformed humans. What happens then, if you can build a model that behaves like a recruiter who really slows down and reads everything? These results make me believe that resumes do carry some signal, and you can uncover it if you carefully read what people write about their jobs and themselves and also analyze how they write it. Unfortunately, this takes more time and effort to uncover than most human recruiters are able to devote. And, in retrospect, that’s a good task for AI. Though we haven’t built a model like that for this post, I’m optimistic that we may be able to do it in the future. As I said in the AI piece I linked above, in order for AI to do useful recruiting work, rather than just perpetuating the biases that human recruiters hold, it needs a data set that contains some objective measure of performance. Most recruiting AI models today do one of three things: glorified keyword matching, training on what recruiters prefer (the outcome is whether a recruiter would want to talk to the candidate, NOT whether the candidate is good), or live on top of existing tools like ChatGPT (which we recently showed doesn’t perform very well and is biased against non-traditional candidates). These three approaches just result in the wrong thing being done, faster. I hope that, in the not too distant future, we can use AI to make less-biased decisions, using meaningful performance data. And I hope that this type of AI solution can get adoption among the recruiting community. Footnotes: Footnotes Participating technical recruiters were paid a base rate and then received additional $$ for each accurate prediction. ↩ Different roles have different requirements. To correct for that, we asked each candidate to specify which eng role they were applying for: Software Engineer (back-end or full-stack), Mobile Engineer, Front-end Engineer, ML Engineer, Data Engineer, or Engineering Manager. Then we prompted recruiters to evaluate them specifically for that role. If no role was specified by the candidate, the default role to evaluate for was Software Engineer (back-end or full-stack). ↩ Top firms = Airbnb, Amazon, Anthropic, AWS, Apple, Asana, Atlassian, Bloomberg LP, Checkr, Coinbase, Coursera, Cruise, Dropbox, Etsy, Facebook, Flexport, GitHub, Google, Gusto, HashiCorp, Instacart, Instagram, Jane Street, Jump Trading, Khan Academy, LinkedIn, Lyft, Medium, Microsoft, Mozilla, Netflix, Oculus, OpenAI, Palantir, Peloton, Pinterest, Postmates, Quora, Reddit, Robinhood, Roblox, Salesforce, Segment, Slack, Snap, Snowflake, SpaceX, Spotify, Square, Stripe, Tesla, Thumbtack, TikTok, Twilio, Twitch, Twitter, Two Sigma, Uber, Udemy, Waymo, Whatsapp, Yelp, and Zoom. ↩ We corrected by FAANG & FAANG-adjacent experience (and all of our other variables) before making this statement, i.e., the effect existed for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds who did not have FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies on their resumes. We expect that recruiters favor underrepresented minority candidates because of guidelines from their employers to focus on sourcing these types of candidates, as part of DEI initiatives. Discussion about the magnitude of this effect and its implications is out of scope of this piece. ↩ Interestingly, recruiters might penalize, for example, alternative education. Candidates with only alternative education pathways post-high school — coding bootcamps or digital certifications — appeared to be penalized by recruiters in this study. However, with limited observations (n=11), it’s inconclusive without further study. ↩ That field was optional, so most of the reasons recruiters provided were in cases when they said no — presumably because the reasons for saying yes may have seemed self-evident. ↩ It’s not that recruiters who generally take their time make more accurate judgements. Any recruiter slowing down might make them better at judging resumes! ↩ It’s important to stress that neither algorithm was custom-built. The models, one using a Random Forest algorithm and the other an XGBoost algorithm, are distinct but interrelated approaches akin to Decision Tree algorithms. Decision trees sort data into groups based on features. Random forest algorithms combine multiple decision trees to improve predictions. XGBoost builds multiple decision trees one after another, with each new tree focusing on prediction errors from the previous trees. ↩ Training data excluded data in this study. We take user privacy very seriously, and we want to stress that all models were local and anonymized and that no data in this study was shared with cloud LLMs. ↩ To see a particularly egregious example of recruiters favoring brands over substance, take a close look at this fake resume that got a bunch of recruiter responses. And this one too. ↩ We haven’t proven causality here, but when we just scoped our analysis to the same person, it appeared that taking more time did help (in other words, it’s not just that recruiters who spend more time usually are more accurate; it’s the added time).

Read 9 chapters for free →interviewing.ioOpen menuInterview resourcesFor employersGift mock interviewsBlogFAQLog inGive it a tryBlog HomeThe unwritten rules (till now) of negotiating with MetaBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 27, 2024; Last updated: February 25, 2025If you don't like reading, here's me presenting the contents of this blog post in a video. Pick your poison. EDIT: This post is based on stories from users who were interviewing for E4-E6 SWE and MLE roles at Meta. Other, more specialized roles may have different processes than what's described here. EDIT 2: As of Q1 2025, it looks like Meta is sometimes foregoing team matching in favor of driving candidates to their Monetization org (which apparently has a lot of open headcount). If this happens to you, after you pass the hiring committee, instead of entering team matching, your recruiter will tell you that you’ve been assigned to this particular org and, if you proceed, you’ll just get an offer. You won’t get to talk to your future manager, and you’ll find out team details a week after you join. From what we know, it’s possible to insist on team matching instead, with the downside that it’ll take an unknown amount of time rather than certainty. Why does this matter? If you’re looking to use your Meta offer primarily as leverage with other companies, this is a great thing because you’ll get numbers quickly. If you’re seriously interested in Meta, then this could be good or bad and depends where you are in the process and how much you want to work on monetization versus other things/how much you want to meet your manager before you work for them. So if you’re seriously interested in Meta, whether this is good or bad depends on where you are in the process. If you need them to move quickly, it’s great because you know you won’t be stuck in team matching. However, if you need them to slow down because you aren’t as far along with other companies or because you want to work in a different org, you may want to ask your recruiter to stick with the old team matching process. In our experience, it’s ok to ask this. Your recruiter may not tell you outright that that’s an option, but if you ask, they will probably do it. Of course, you may be stuck longer than you want. But at least then you will have more of a say in what you work on. At interviewing.io, one of the services we offer our users is salary negotiation. Even though I’m the founder, I still do many of the sessions myself because they give me an invaluable insider’s perspective on what’s actually going on in the engineering market, what different companies’ offers look like, how companies extend offers, what kinds of deadlines they give, and how much they go up in compensation, under what circumstances. Access to this kind of data is great because it helps me make better business decisions. But sometimes I see questionable patterns of behavior among companies. Recently, I’ve observed a string of practices at Meta that I find reprehensible, and that’s what this post is about. I’ve seen the same practices with enough candidates, and across enough different titles and positions, that it’s become clear to me that they are not isolated incidents or a rogue recruiter’s doing but rather a consistent implementation of a deliberate strategy that comes from the top. I’m writing about this for two reasons. First, if you’re negotiating with Meta, you need to know how they operate and understand the unwritten rules of the game. If you do not know the rules, you will fail — long before you even start negotiating. Second, I’m hoping that someone at Meta sees this post and that maybe it’ll spark an internal discussion about changing the rules. By the way, if I’m wrong, I will gladly issue a retraction and a public apology. Please contact me if you’re a recruiter at Meta and find something incorrect in this post. My email is aline@interviewing.io. Lastly, if you’re about to interview there or are interviewing there already, please read our free, long-form guide to their interview process and questions. Meta basically has a monopoly on FAANG hiring right now I mentioned above that we do salary negotiation, but our main business is mock interviews. We offer anonymous mock interviews in the style of a bunch of different companies (mostly FAANGs). This means we know how many people are practicing for interviews at Google vs. Meta vs. other FAANGs, and that lets us guess (pretty accurately) how much hiring is actually happening at these companies. You can read in way more detail about how all the FAANGs are doing in our recent blog post where we made 2024 predictions based on our proprietary data. But while I was writing that post, I noticed something odd. Meta was hiring way more engineers than any of the other FAANGs. In fact, Meta hiring is up more than 10X since January of last year. You can see that more recently Amazon has picked up a bit, but it’s very recent and not enough to drive major change in other companies’ behaviors (at least not yet). And, yes, Netflix is hiring too, but Meta’s eng team is more than 10X the size of Netflix’s, so in the absolute, Netflix’s hiring volume isn’t enough to balance Meta out. For all intents and purposes, Meta’s the only FAANG that’s really hiring at scale — and they’re currently getting away with treating candidates really poorly as a result. How Meta negotiates, given their effective monopoly on eng hiring Here’s how Meta runs their hiring process. These practices have been consistent across every negotiation client we’ve had in the past 6 months or so. Meta’s hiring is centralized, which means that you enter one big interview process that’s completely divorced from which team you might end up on and you interview with people whom you might never work with again. If you do well, there will be a team matching component after you pass the onsite but before you get an offer1. With that in mind, here’s how they run their process, once you get the green light. Team matching. This can take days or weeks, depending on how many teams you speak to and how many conversations you have with the people on each team. You'll speak with hiring managers to gauge fit and chemistry, and if you’d like, you can also talk to peers. We've heard that sometimes you get the chance to talk to a handful of teams, and sometimes it's over 10. After your team-matching conversations, your recruiter will ask you to choose a team. In order to move forward, both you and the hiring manager have to opt in2. Likely down-level you. Sometime during team matching, you’ll probably find out that you’ve been down-leveled. Often, your recruiter will cite your performance in the system design portion (and sometimes the behavioral portion). According to a recent survey we did, something like 55% of Meta candidates get down-leveled (more likely for generalist SWE roles, less likely for more niche roles like ML). Make a lowball offer with just a few days to make a decision. Once you’re done with team matching, things get dicey. Your recruiter will make you a lowball offer that’s often $50k or more (!!) below the average TC on levels.fyi. Moreover, you usually just get a couple of days to make a decision. If you were down-leveled, your lowball offer may include a small signing bonus as a consolation prize. Refuse to negotiate unless you can show them other offers from comparable companies. Your recruiter will say something like, “If you’d like to increase your offer, I can take this to the compensation committee, but I need a compelling reason \\[i.e., another offer\\].\" If you have other offers, they will apologize for the lowball offer, citing that it’s “automatic numbers from our computer” and raise the numbers by $100K or more (in first year’s TC). If you do not, you will be stuck with a lowball offer, though you may be able to negotiate a small signing bonus if the offer didn’t come with one already. How to negotiate with Meta Below are the steps for negotiating with Meta in a hard climate where they have a monopoly on hiring. We hope that most of these won’t be necessary in the future. They are: Don’t share anything with your recruiter Make sure you have other offers Slow-play team matching Build rapport with every hiring manager you talk to Actually negotiate (this is the easy part) Don’t share anything with your recruiter We wrote a whole post about how to avoid sharing information with your recruiter and why this is so vital. If you share where you’re interviewing or how far along you are, or if you start negotiating prematurely, the strategies below won’t work. Please read our post on not shooting yourself in the foot during negotiations before you continue! You should also be aware of a few tricks specific to Meta recruiters. If you're not forthcoming about where else you're interviewing, they may say a few sneaky things. First, they may say something like, \"Well, we just want to know where you're interviewing so we can intro you to others who interviewed at those companies but ultimately chose Meta.\" Don't fall for that early in the process. It's a trap to get information out of you. You can always ask for those intros later, when you're negotiating and it's the right time information about your other offers. The other thing they do is fish, saying something like, \"Well, in case you're interviewing at {Google, Netflix, some other big company they don't want to lose candidates to}, just so you know, they move kind of slowly, so we may not be able to wait.\" There, the Meta recruiter's goal is to get you to say, \"Oh, no, don't worry, I'm not interviewing at Google!\" Now, you've lost leverage in their eyes because that's one less competitive company they might lose you to... and they'll be more confident about lowballing you later on. Make sure you have other offers As you may have guessed from reading the previous section, it’s critical to have other offers, and not just any offers but ones from top-tier companies who pay very competitively3. We realize that saying “have other offers” doesn’t capture the blood, sweat, and tears that go into months of interview prep, applications, emails, recruiter calls, and interviews. We know it’s hard, but as you’ll see, it makes a huge difference in your compensation. Getting those offers doesn’t start when you’ve received your Meta offer. It starts months before. Make sure that you get enough initial conversations with other FAANGs, FAANG-adjacent companies, and late-stage sexy startups to end up with at least one other offer, ideally at least two. Depending on your interview performance, this might be anywhere from 4 to 10 initial conversations.4 Slow-play team matching Having your offers come in around the same time is critical for any negotiation, but it’s especially important with Meta because they take such a hard line — without other offers, they will not meaningfully budge. Obviously, you’ll want to start your conversations with other companies well in advance of your Meta interviews and do everything you can to make sure they all come in at the same time. However, even with your best efforts, it’s not guaranteed that your timing will match up. Here’s how to make sure that your offers come in at the same time: slow-play Meta’s team-matching process. Team matching is actually the part of your Meta journey where you have the most leverage and power. Why leverage? At this point, they know they want you, but they can’t yet hold an offer deadline over you. We’ve already mentioned that once they make the offer, your recruiter is going to push very hard to have you accept, often giving you a deadline of something like two days. In your recruiter’s eyes, you’re a ticking time bomb, where for every day you don’t sign, the deal loses momentum, and your odds of signing drop off. Recruiters are also evaluated on how many candidates they close, so it’s in their interest to create a false sense of scarcity in order to rush you and to use high-pressure sales tactics to get you to seal the deal. And what power do you have? It turns out you can really control how long team matching takes, within reason. If you’re still wrapping phone screens with other companies, slow-playing is the best thing you can do. Here’s how to do it. We’ve recently heard that Meta is now insisting that hiring manager conversations happen in series, but even if Meta lets you talk to multiple hiring managers concurrently, try to serialize those conversations as much as possible. For instance, if you hear from your recruiter that you’re going to start team matching on a Monday, and they offer to set up some calls for Wednesday, ask to do the first call on a Friday and the next call the following Tuesday. When we advise our users to do this, we often get pushback because they’re worried that slowing things down will make them look disinterested/not serious. We promise you that’s not the case. The biggest risk you run when you slow-play team matching scheduling like this is losing the chance to work on a specific team. If you find that your recruiter has proposed what seems like the perfect team for you, you can and should prioritize doing that call as soon as possible. In addition to serializing your hiring manager conversations, for each team, ask to talk to a few individual contributors on teams that you’re serious about. This isn’t just a stalling tactic. These are the people you’ll be working closely with every day, and they’re the ones doing the job you may have in the future. They’re also less likely to do hard sells, and if you ask thoughtful questions, you’ll learn a lot about what to expect. We’re always surprised by how few candidates ask to speak to their future peers, out of a mistaken concern that asking for too much will make them look disinterested or unengaged. Just like with hiring manager calls, if you need to slow things down, we recommend scheduling calls with your peers a few days apart. Situations where slow-playing may bite you, and how to know the difference We have seen two instances when our advice about slow-playing could backfire. You probably remember when companies started to freeze hiring aggressively in mid-2022 — if you didn’t get matched before the ax came down, you were left out in the cold. Much more recently, we heard from some of our users that Meta put a pause on team matching for E4 roles (largely outside the Bay Area), and many candidates were stuck in a holding pattern (while Meta figured out headcount constraints, though it looks like it’s since been resolved, and picking back up in earnest. Slow-playing and then getting stuck is obviously an unfortunate situation, as is being on the wrong end of a hiring freeze, but these situations are rare, and in our humble opinion, not worth optimizing for — in most cases, you will not be dealing with an impending freeze or stalled matching. If you’re unsure about team supply or the state of hiring, you can do two things: Always ask your recruiter up front to share the number of teams that candidates have had the chance to talk to, on average, recently. Look at our real-time graph of FAANG hiring volume (as opposed to the graph above, which is a monthly snapshot). In this real-time graph, you can see what portion of our mock interview volume is dedicated to practice in the style of Meta, Amazon, and Google. Historically, our purchasing behavior has lined up very well with what’s actually going on in the market, and the rate of change in this graph should give you an idea of whether Meta is slowing down. As you can see, there was a dip in February (and one in December, but that almost always happens because hiring slows down over the holidays). If you see dips like these, you’ll want to make sure that you do (1) and ask your recruiter about the situation inside. You may also choose not to slow-play for too long. There's one more situation where slow-playing may bite you. If you match with a team and really click well with the manager, to the point where you have your heart set on it, it may be wise to accept that team instead of trying to drag things out. We've heard of times where, even if the candidate asked the manager about open headcount and confirmed they didn't have to rush, the role got filled from under them (they were able to talk to other teams afterwards but missed the chance to be on that specific team). If a specific team feels irreplaceable to you and you'd be crushed if you didn't get it, then that may be more important than maximizing your negotiation. Build rapport with every hiring manager you talk to Outside of using the team-matching process to control your timeline, there is one other important tactical piece of advice: Do your best to build rapport with hiring managers. As we said above, recruiters are trying to close the deal. That’s their job. Hiring managers, on the other hand, are trying to lay the groundwork for a good working relationship with you. As a result, their interests are much more aligned with yours. Of course, they still want to close you, but it’s not worth it to them to employ high-pressure tactics, and it’s not something they’re trained in or comfortable with (in fact, many of them hated these tactics when they were on the other end of it while looking for work)5. As such, hiring managers will generally be a lot more transparent with you about how much time you actually have to make a decision, and their answers will likely be very different from the ones you get from recruiters. We’ve advised all of our Meta candidates to ask their prospective hiring managers about when they realistically have to make a decision by, and the differences between what the hiring manager has told them (“Take your time; you have a few weeks at least.”) and what their recruiter has told them (“We’re talking to a lot of candidates for that team. To ensure your spot, you should make a decision in the next few days.”) are stark. There’s simply no downside to building rapport with hiring managers. At worst, you make a professional connection. At best, you get a head start on a great working relationship with your new boss. One practical note: Always ask your hiring manager for their email address in case you have more questions later. This way, if your recruiter starts telling you that you need to make a decision by Friday, you can ping your hiring manager, explain that you’re still thinking, and ask if it’s OK to take a few more days. Almost always they will say yes. Actually negotiate (this is the easy part) If you’ve done everything else in this post, the negotiation is the easy part. By now, you’ve wrapped up team matching, chosen a team, and have likely gotten an aggressive offer deadline. You have also not shared any offer details till now. As we said at the beginning of this post, the success of your strategy hinges on the recruiter not being aware of the other companies you’re interviewing with. This will be the first time they find out about it, and that will put them on their proverbial back foot. To respond to the offer, you can send an email6 that looks something like the below. The details will differ, and how much you reveal about the other offers will vary, but here’s the general idea. Hey \\[Recruiter name\\], Thank you so much for the offer, for working with me throughout this process, and for all your help with team matching. I wanted to share some details with you. I currently have offers from {Company 1}, {Company 2}, and {Company 3}. {Company 1} has offered me a significantly higher base salary of $220k. {Company 2} has a comparable base but has offered me significantly more equity: $500k. I know {Company 2} is a startup, but they’re late stage and handing out RSUs. Those RSUs are as valuable to me as public company equity. Finally, {Company 3} has thrown in a meaningful signing bonus, and their performance bonus is actually at 25%, not 15%. I’m very excited about the opportunity to work at Meta and about the team. {Insert some authentic reasons why you’re excited about the company, the team, your new boss, etc.} It’d be great to see a meaningful increase in compensation to make my decision easier. Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you. By the way, this isn’t the only approach you can take, and with other companies, you might have better luck with the Reverse Used Car Salesman. However, in our experience, if you don’t share offer details, your Meta recruiter will immediately ask you to share, so you might as well control the flow of information. In the template above, I’ve assumed that not all of your offers are stronger than Meta’s across the board, which is why I’ve cherry-picked which pieces to share. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, you’ll have multiple offers that have a higher base, more equity, and a higher signing bonus. In that case, it’s less of a game of skill — just throw the numbers at them, and they’ll exceed the other offers without much prompting. If you run this play, your recruiter will apologize for low-balling you, blaming the “computer” for giving them those numbers. Then, like clockwork, you will see a $50k to $150k jump in your offer (precisely how much depends on where your other offers are from and how strong they are).7 Now, whether you take that offer is up to you. Some closing thoughts. I’m a capitalist. Meta’s behavior here is aggressively capitalistic, if short-sighted – once other FAANGs start meaningfully hiring again, and Meta employees figure out that there’s a $150k comp differential between people with the same job title, they’re going to pay the piper and likely see a bunch of attrition. Ultimately, the market will correct these practices. However, I also believe that individuals have the right and duty to be as informed as possible and to wield whatever weapons in their arsenal to advocate for themselves, rather than waiting on the mercy of slow, indifferent market forces. As such, we hope this post has given you some ammunition in your negotiations and helped reduce the information asymmetry between you and Meta, a huge, aggressive player with basically a monopoly on eng hiring at the moment. And we hope that if anyone from Meta is reading this, it’ll spark some internal conversations about what’s right. And if they don’t, other FAANGs’ recruiters will swoop in soon enough.

In the past, you’d get an offer before you matched with a team and do a 6-week “bootcamp” where you’d get up to speed on Meta’s tech stack, infrastructure, and systems, followed by a multi-week “speed dating”-esque team matching cycle. Bootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter (2-4 weeks), and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers continue to ramp up on their specific teams. ↩ We’ve recently heard that Meta may now be insisting that team matching conversations happen in serial, i.e., you can only do one at a time. However, this doesn’t meaningfully change our advice. ↩ You might say, “Aline, why can’t I just make up offers?” We could never, in good conscience, advise that. It’s unethical, and though I’d argue that while Meta’s negotiation practices are also unethical, that’s not the way to win. Outside of ethical considerations, while the risks of getting caught are low, they’re not zero. Lying about offers, in our mind, is the last refuge of the incompetent. ↩ The advice in this post is orthogonal from your career goals and what you want to work on. This blog post is about navigating an unfair system filled with opaque rules while maximizing your cash. It is not about self-actualization, though we’d argue that creating the most optionality for yourself helps with self-actualization as well. You can also talk to smaller companies and use your big-co offers as leverage to increase your startup equity. There’s nothing wrong with that, but more detail on optionality and self-actualization is outside the scope of this post. ↩ Of course, some hiring managers will use high-pressure sales tactics or create false timelines to try to close you. But that’s the exception rather than the rule. You can decide if that’s something that you want to weigh when judging whether or not you want to work for them. ↩ We strongly urge you to avoid negotiating over the phone and over text, whenever possible. Your recruiter does 5 of these calls a day. You might do one of these calls every few years. Do the hard part over email. It’s the best way to level the playing field. Read this post to learn how to avoid synchronous phone negotiations (just look for “phone”). ↩ One advanced maneuver is to pit all your other companies against each other and raise up their initial offers BEFORE talking to Meta.

We ran an experiment.By Mike Mroczka | Published: January 31, 2024; Last updated: May 6, 2024Edit: This article originally contained a TikTok video of someone cheating in an interview with ChatGPT. Videos like this still can be found online, but companies hate them, so they don't stay up for long ChatGPT has revolutionized work as we know it. From helping small businesses automate their administrative tasks to coding entire React components for web developers, its usefulness is hard to overstate. At interviewing.io, we've been thinking a lot about how ChatGPT will change technical interviewing. One big question is: Does ChatGPT make it easy to cheat in interviews? You've probably started to hear concerns about students cheating on their homework with ChatGPT, and we are certain that some people have tried to cheat in interviews with it, too! Initial responses to cheating software have been pretty much in line with what you’d expect: Redditors state that “ChatGPT is the end of coding as we know it.” YouTubers announce that “Software engineering is dead. ChatGPT killed it.” X (formerly Twitter) questions if “​​ChatGPT spell(s) the end for Coding Interviews?” It seems clear that ChatGPT can assist people during their interviews, but we wanted to know: How much can it help? How easy is it to cheat (and get away with it)? Will companies that ask LeetCode questions need to make significant changes to their interview process? To answer these questions, we recruited some of our professional interviewers and users for a cheating experiment! Below, we’ll share everything we discovered and explain what it means for you. As a little preview, just know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately. The experiment interviewing.io is an interview practice platform and recruiting marketplace for engineers. Engineers use us for mock interviews. Companies use us to hire top performers. We have thousands of professional interviewers in our ecosystem, and hundreds of thousands of engineers have used our platform to prepare for interviews.1 Interviewers Interviewers came from our pool of professional interviewers. They were broken into three groups, with each group asking a different type of question. The interviewers had no idea that the experiment was about ChatGPT or cheating; we told them that \"\\[this\\] research study aims to understand the trends in the predictability of an interviewer’s decisions over time – especially when asking standard vs. non-standard interview questions.\" These were the three question types: Verbatim LeetCode questions: questions pulled directly from LeetCode at the interviewer's discretion with no modifications to the question. Example: The Sort Colors LeetCode question is asked exactly as it is written. Modified LeetCode questions: questions pulled from LeetCode and then modified to be similar to the original but still notably different from it. Example: The Sort Colors question above but modified to have four integers (0,1,2,3) instead of just three integers (0,1,2) in the input. Custom questions: questions that aren’t directly tied to any question that exists online. Example: You are given a log file with the following format: - : \\- \\- Your task is to identify the user who represents the median level of engagement in a conversation. Only consider users with a contribution score greater than 50%. Assume that the number of such users is odd, and you need to find the one right in the middle when sorted by their contribution scores. Given the file below, the correct answer is SyntaxSorcerer. LOG FILE START NullPointerNinja: \"who's going to the event tomorrow night?\" - 100% LambdaLancer: \"wat?\" - 5% NullPointerNinja: \"the event which is on 123 avenue!\" - 100% SyntaxSorcerer: \"I'm coming! I'll bring chips!\" - 80% SyntaxSorcerer: \"and something to drink!\" - 80% LambdaLancer: \"I can't make it\" - 25% LambdaLancer: \"🙁\" - 25% LambdaLancer: \"I really wanted to come too!\" - 25% BitwiseBard: \"I'll be there!\" - 25% CodeMystic: \"me too and I'll brink some dip\" - 75% LOG FILE END For more information about question types and about how we designed this experiment, please read the Interviewer Experiment Guidelines doc that we shared with participating interviewers. Interviewees Interviewees came from our pool of active users and were invited to participate in a short survey. We selected interviewees who: Were actively looking for a job in today's market Had 4+ years of experience and were applying to senior-level positions Rated their “ChatGPT while coding” familiarity as moderate to high Identified themselves as someone who thought they could cheat in an interview without getting caught This selection helped us skew the candidates toward people who could feasibly cheat in an interview, had the motivation to do so, and were already reasonably familiar with ChatGPT and coding interviews. We told interviewees that they had to use ChatGPT in the interview, and the goal was to test their ability to cheat with ChatGPT. They were also told not to try to pass the interview with their own skills — the point was to rely on ChatGPT. We ended up conducting 37 interviews overall, 32 of which we were able to use (we had to remove 5 because participants didn’t follow directions): 11 with the “verbatim” treatment 9 with the “modified” treatment 12 with the “custom” treatment A quick disclaimer. Because our platform allows for anonymity, our interviews have audio but no video. We’re anonymous because we want to create a safe space for our users to fail and learn quickly without judgment. It’s great for our users, but we acknowledge that not having video in these interviews makes our experiment less realistic. In a real interview, you will be on camera with a job on the line, which makes cheating harder — but does not eliminate it. After the interviews, both interviewers and interviewees had to complete an exit survey. We asked interviewees about the difficulties of using ChatGPT during the interview, and interviewers were given multiple chances to express concerns about the interview — we wanted to see how many interviewers would flag their interviews as problematic and report that they suspected cheating. Post-survey interviewee questions Post-survey interviewer questions We had no idea what would happen in this experiment, but we assumed that if half the candidates that cheated got away with it and passed the interview, it would be a telling result for our industry. Results After removing interviews where participants did not follow instructions2, we got the following results. Our control was how candidates performed in interviewing.io mock interviews outside the study: 53%.3 Note that most mock interviews on our platform are LeetCode-style questions, which makes sense because that's primarily what FAANG companies ask. We'll come back to this in a moment. 'Verbatim' questions passed significantly more often, compared to both our platform average and to 'custom' questions. 'Verbatim' and 'modified' questions were not statistically significantly differnt from each other. 'Custom' questions had a significantly lower pass rate than any of the other groups. “Verbatim” questions Predictably, the verbatim group performed the best, passing 73% of their interviews. Interviewees reported that they got the perfect solution from ChatGPT. The most notable comment from the post-interview survey for this group is below — we think it is particularly telling of what was going on in many of the interviewers’ minds: “It's tough to determine if the candidate breezed through the question because they're actually good or if they've heard this question before. Normally, I add 1-2 unique twists to the problem to ascertain the difference.” Normally, this interviewer would have followed up with a modified question to get more signal, so let’s examine the “modified” group next to see if interviewers actually got more signal by adding a twist to their questions. “Modified” questions Remember, this group may have had a LeetCode question given to them, which was standard but modified in a way that was not directly available online. This means ChatGPT couldn’t have had a direct answer to this question. Hence, the interviewees were much more dependent on ChatGPT's actual problem-solving abilities than its ability to regurgitate LeetCode tutorials. As predicted, the results for this group weren’t too different from the “verbatim” group, with 67% of candidates passing their interviews. As it turns out, this difference was not statistically significantly different from the \"verbatim\" group, i.e., “modified” and “verbatim” are essentially the same. This result suggests that ChatGPT can handle minor modifications to questions without much trouble. Interviewees did notice, however, that it took more prompting to get ChatGPT to solve the modified questions. As one of our interviewees said: “Questions that are lifted directly from LeetCode were no problem at all. A follow-up question that was not so much directly LeetCode-style was much harder to get ChatGPT to answer.” “Custom” questions As expected, the “custom” question group had the lowest pass rate, with only 25% of candidates passing. Not only is it statistically significantly smaller than the other two treatment groups, it's significantly lower than the control! When you ask candidates fully custom questions, they perform worse than they do when they're not cheating (and getting asked LeetCode-style questions)! Note that this number, when initially calculated, was marginally higher, but after reviewing the custom questions in detail, we discovered a problem with this question type we hadn’t anticipated, which had skewed the results minorly toward a higher pass rate. Read the section below called \"Companies: Change the questions you are asking immediately!\" to find out what that problem was. No one was caught cheating! In our experiment, interviewers were not aware that the interviewees were being asked to cheat. As you recall, after each interview, we had interviewers complete a survey in which they had to describe how confident they were in their assessments of candidates. Interviewer confidence in the correctness of their assessments was high, with 72% saying they were confident in their hiring decision. One interviewer felt so strongly about an interviewee's performance that they concluded we should invite them to be an interviewer on the platform! “The candidate performed very well and demonstrated knowledge of a strong Amazon L6 (Google L5) SWE... and could also be considered to be an interviewer/mentor on interviewing.io.” That is a lot of confidence after just one interview — probably too much! We’ve long known that engineers are bad at gauging their own performance, so perhaps it shouldn’t come as a shock to find that interviewers also overestimate the effectiveness of the questions that they ask. Of the interviewers who were not confident in their hiring choice (28%), we asked them why. This was the frequency distribution of their reasons. Note that cheating isn’t mentioned anywhere! Most interviewers concerned about their hiring decision expressed specific reasons for their lack of confidence. These issues typically included suboptimal solutions, missed edge cases, messy code, or poor communication. We specifically included an “Other Issue” category to see if they would express a concern that the interviewee was cheating, but digging deeper revealed only minor grievances like “personality issues” and “they need to speed up their coding.” In addition to having this opportunity to call out cheating, interviewers were prompted three additional times to note any other concerns they had with the interview, including free-form text boxes and several multiple-choice questions with options to explain their concerns. When an interviewee bombed because they didn’t understand the ChatGPT response, the interviewer chalked up the interviewee’s odd behavior and stilted responses to a lack of practice — not cheating. One interviewer thought the candidate's problem-solving was fine but commented that they were slow and needed to consider edge cases more carefully. “Candidate did not seem prepared for any LeetCode questions.\" “Candidate's approach lacked clarity, and they jumped into the coding too early.” “The candidate was not prepared to tackle even the most basic coding questions on LeetCode.” “Good problem solving in general, but the candidate needs to be faster at coding and identifying critical edge cases.” So, who reported concerns about cheating? And who got caught? As it turns out, not a single interviewer mentioned concerns about any of the candidates cheating! We were stunned to discover that interviewers reported no suspicions of cheating, and interestingly, interviewees were largely confident that they were getting away with it, too. 81% reported no concerns about being caught, 13% thought they might have tipped off the interviewer, and an astonishingly small 6% of participants thought the interviewer suspected them of cheating. Interviewees were mostly sure that their cheating went undetected The candidates who worried they were caught did have abnormal comments from the interviewers in the post-survey analysis, but they still were not suspected of cheating. To summarize, most candidates thought they were getting away with cheating — and they were right! Companies: Change the questions you are asking immediately! The obvious conclusion from these results is that companies need to start asking custom questions immediately, or they are at serious risk of candidates cheating during interviews (and ultimately not getting useful signal from their interviews)! ChatGPT has made verbatim questions obsolete; anyone relying on them will be naively leaving their hiring processes up to chance. Hiring is already tricky enough without worrying about cheating. If you’re part of a company that uses verbatim LeetCode questions, please share this post internally! Using custom questions isn’t just a good way to prevent cheating. It filters out candidates who have memorized a bunch of LeetCode solutions (as you saw, our custom question pass rate was significantly lower than our control). It also meaningfully improves candidate experience, which makes people way more likely to want to work for you. A while ago, we did an analysis of what makes good interviewers good. Not surprisingly, asking good questions was one of the hallmarks, and our best-rated interviewers were the ones who tended to ask custom questions! Question quality was extremely significant in our study, regarding whether the candidate wanted to move forward with the company. It was much more important than the company’s brand strength, which mattered for getting candidates in the door but didn’t matter relative to question quality once they were in process. As some of our interviewees said… “Always nice to get questions that are more than just plain algorithms.” “I liked the question — it takes a relatively simple algorithms problem (build and traverse a tree) and adds some depth. I also liked that the interviewer connected the problem to a real product at \\[Redacted\\], which made it feel less like a toy problem and more like a pared-down version of a real problem.” “This is my favorite question that I’ve encountered on this site. It was one of the only ones that seemed to have real-life applicability and was drawn from a real (or potentially real) business challenge. And it also nicely wove in challenges like complexity, efficiency, and blocking.” One more somewhat subtle piece of advice for companies who decide to move to more custom questions. You might be tempted to take verbatim LeetCode questions and change up the wording or some of the window dressing. That makes sense, because it’s certainly easier than coming up with questions from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn’t work. As we mentioned earlier, we discovered in this experiment that just because a question looks like a custom question, doesn’t mean it is one. Questions can appear custom and still be identical to an existing LeetCode question. When making questions to ask candidates, it isn’t enough to obscure an existing problem. You need to ensure that the problem has unique inputs and outputs to be effective at stopping ChatGPT from recognizing it! The questions that interviewers ask are confidential, and we cannot share the exact questions that our interviewers used in the experiment. However, we can give you an indicative example. Below is a “custom question” with this critical flaw, which is easy for ChatGPT to beat: For her birthday, Mia received a mysterious box containing numbered cards and a note saying, \"Combine two cards that add up to 18 to unlock your gift!\" Help Mia find the right pair of cards to reveal her surprise. Input: An array of integers (the numbers on the cards), and the target sum (18). arr = \\[1, 3, 5, 10, 8\\], target = 18 Output: The indices of the two cards that add up to the target sum. In this case, \\[3, 4\\] because index 3 and 4 add to 18 (10+8). Did you spot the issue? While this question appears “custom” at first glance, its objective is identical to the popular TwoSum question: finding two numbers that sum to a given target. The inputs and outputs are identical; the only thing “custom” about the question is the story added to the problem. Seeing that this is identical to known problems, it shouldn’t be a surprise to learn that ChatGPT does well on questions that have inputs and outputs identical to existing known problems — even when they have a unique story added to them. How to actually create good custom questions One thing we’ve found incredibly useful for coming up with good, original questions is to start a shared doc with your team where every time someone solves a problem they think is interesting, no matter how small, they jot down a quick note. These notes don’t have to be fleshed out at all, but they can be the seeds for unique interview questions that give candidates insight into the day-to-day at your company. Turning these disjointed seeds into interview questions takes thought and effort — you have to prune a lot of the details and distill the essence of the problem into something that doesn’t take the candidate a lot of work/setup to grok. You’ll also likely have to iterate on these home-grown questions a few times before you get them right — but the payoff can be huge. To be clear, we’re not advocating the removal of data structures and algorithms from technical interviews. DS&A questions have gotten a bad reputation because of bad, unengaged interviewers and because of companies lazily rehashing LeetCode problems, many of them bad, which have nothing to do with their work. In the hands of good interviewers, those questions are powerful and useful. If you use the approach above, you’ll be able to come up with new data structure & algorithmic questions that have a practical foundation and component that will engage candidates and get them excited about the work you’re doing. You’ll also be moving our industry forward. It’s not OK that memorizing a bunch of LeetCode questions gives candidates an edge in today’s interview process, nor is it OK that interviews have gotten to a state where cheating starts to look like a rational choice. The solution is more work on the employer’s part to come up with better questions. Let’s all do it together. Real talk for job seekers All right, now, for all of you who are actively looking for work, listen up! Yes, a subset of your peers will now be using ChatGPT to cheat in interviews, and at companies that ask LeetCode questions (sadly, many of them), those peers will have an edge… for a short while. Right now, we’re in a liminal state where companies’ processes have not caught up to reality. They will, soon enough, either by moving away from using verbatim LeetCode questions entirely (which will be a boon for our entire industry) or by returning to in-person onsites (which will make cheating largely impossible past the technical screen) or both. It sucks that other candidates cheating is another thing to worry about in an already difficult climate, but we cannot, in good conscience, endorse cheating to “level the playing field.” In addition, interviewees who used ChatGPT uniformly reported how much more difficult the interview was to complete while juggling the AI. Below, you can view one interviewee stumbling through their time complexity analysis after giving a perfect answer to an interview question. The interviewer is confused as the interviewee scrambles to explain how they got to their incorrect time complexity (secretly provided by ChatGPT). While no one was caught during the study, their cameras were off, and cheating was still difficult for many of our skilled candidates, as evidenced by this clip. Ethics aside, cheating is difficult, stressful, and not entirely straightforward to implement. Instead, we advise investing that effort into practice, which will serve you well once companies change their processes, which hopefully should be soon. Ultimately, we hope the advent of ChatGPT will be the catalyst that finally moves our industry’s interview standards away from grinding and memorizing to actually testing engineering ability.

In my experience, one of the hardest things about negotiating your salary is knowing what to say in tough, ambiguous situations with a power balance that’s not in your favor. What’s OK? What’s rude? What are the social norms? And so on. Before I started interviewing.io, I’ve worked as a software engineer, an in-house recruiter, and an agency recruiter, so I’ve literally been on all sides of the negotiating table. For the last few years, I’ve been guest-lecturing MIT’s 6.UAT, a class about technical communication for computer science majors. Every semester, negotiation is one of the most-requested topics from students. In this post, I’m sharing the content of that lecture, which is targeted toward students, but has served seasoned industry folks just as well. You’re never too young or too old to advocate for yourself. Btw, if you don’t like reading and prefer long, rambly diatribes in front of an unsightly glass wall, I covered most of this material (and other stuff) in a webinar I did with the fine people at Udacity (where I used to run hiring) a few months ago. So, pick your poison. Why negotiate my salary at all, especially if I’m junior? If you’re early in your career, you might say that negotiation isn’t worth the hassle — after all, junior roles have pretty narrow salary bands. There are a few reasons this view is short-sighted and wrong. First, though it’s pretty unlikely in the grand scheme of things, if you’re applying to a startup, there might come a magical day when your equity is worth something. This is especially true if you’re an early employee — with a good exit, a delta of a few tenths of a percent might end up being worth a down payment on a home in San Francisco. But, let’s get real, your equity is likely worthless (except interviewing.io’s equity… that’s totes gonna be worth something), so let me give you a better, more immediate reason to learn to haggle early in your career, precisely because that’s when the stakes are low. Humans are frighteningly adaptable creatures. Scared of public speaking? Give 3 talks. The first one will be gut-wrenchingly horrific, the stuff of nightmares. Your voice will crack, you’ll mumble, and the whole time, you’ll want to vomit. The next one will be nerve-wracking. The last one will mostly be OK. And after that, you’ll be just fine. Same thing applies to approach anxiety, mathematical proofs, sex, and, you guessed it, salary negotiation! So, make all the awkward, teeth-cringing mistakes now, while it doesn’t matter, and where failure will cost you $5K or $10K a year. Because the further along you get in your career, the bigger the upside will be… and the bigger the downside will be for not negotiating. Not only will the salary bands be wider for senior roles, but as you get more senior, more of your comp comes from equity, and equity has an even wider range for negotiating. Negotiating your stock well can make 6-figure differences and beyond (especially if you apply some of these same skills to negotiating with investors over term sheets, should you ever start your own company)… so learn these skills (and fail) while you’re young, because the older you get, the harder it’s going to be to start and the more high-stakes it’s going to be. So, below, as promised, I’ll give you a few archetypal, stress-inducing situations and what to say, word-for-word in each one. But first, let me address the elephant in the room… Will my offer be rescinded if I try to negotiate my salary? As I mentioned earlier, this blog post is coming out of a lecture I give at MIT. Every semester, I start the negotiation portion of the lecture with the unshakeable refrain that no one will ever rescind your offer for negotiating. Last semester was different, though. I was just starting to feel my oats and get into my talk (the negotiation piece comes about halfway through) and smugly recited the bit about offers never being rescinded, followed by my usual caveat… “unless you act like a douche while negotiating.” Then, a hand shot up in the back of the room. Ah ha, I thought to myself, one of the non-believers. Ready to placate him, I called on the gentleman in the back. “My offer got rescinded for negotiation.” The class broke out into uproarious laughter. I laughed too. It was kind of funny… but it was also unnerving, and I wanted to get to the bottom of it. “Were you a giant jerk when you negotiated?” “Nope.” Shit, OK, what else can I come up with… “Were you applying at a really small company with maybe one open role?” I asked, praying against hope that he’d say yes. “Yes.” “Thank god.” So, there’s the one exception I’ve found so far to my blanket statement. After working with hundreds and hundreds of candidates back when I was still a recruiter, I had never heard or seen an offer get rescinded (and none of my candidates acted like douches while negotiating, thank god), until then. So, if you’re talking to a super small company with one role that closes as soon as they find someone, yes, then they might rescind the offer. But, to be honest, and I’m not just saying this because I was wrong in front of hundreds of bloodthirsty undergrads, an early startup punishing a prospective employee for being entrepreneurial is a huge red flag to me. OK, so, now onto the bit where I tell you exactly what to say.1 What to say when asked to name the first number There will come a time in every job search where a recruiter will ask you about your compensation expectations. This will likely happen very early in said search, maybe even during the first call you’ll ever have with the company. I think this is a heinous, illaudable practice fraught with value asymmetry. Companies know their salary ranges and roughly what you’re worth to them before they ever talk to you (barring phenomenal performance in interviews which kicks you into a different band). And they know what cost of living is in your area. So they already have all the info they need about you, while you have none about them or the role or even your market value. Sure, there are some extenuating circumstances where you are too expensive, e.g. you’re like an L6 at Google and are talking to an early stage startup that can only afford to pay you 100K a year in base, but honestly even in that situation, if the job is cool enough and if you have the savings, you might take it anyway. So, basically, telling them something will only hurt you and never help you. So don’t do it. Now, here’s exactly what to say when asked to name the first number. At this point, I don’t feel equipped to throw out a number because I’d like to find out more about the opportunity first – right now, I simply don’t have the data to be able to say something concrete. If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I also promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you. TADA! What to say when you’re handed an exploding offer Exploding offers, in my book, are the last bastion of the incompetent. The idea goes something like this… if we give a candidate an aggressive deadline, they’ll have less of a chance to talk to other companies. Game theory for the insipid. Having been on the other side of the table, I know just how arbitrary offer deadlines often are. Deadlines make sense when there is a limited number of positions and applicants all come in at the same time (e.g. internships). They do not make any sense in this market, where companies are perpetually hiring all the time — therefore it’s an entirely artificial construct. Joel Spolsky, the creator of Trello and Stack Overflow, had something particularly biting to say on the matter of exploding offers many years ago (the full post, Exploding Offer Season, is really good): “Here’s what you’re thinking. You’re thinking, well, that’s a good company, not my first choice, but still a good offer, and I’d hate to lose this opportunity. And you don’t know for sure if your number one choice would even hire you. So you accept the offer at your second-choice company and never go to any other interviews. And now, you lost out. You’re going to spend several years of your life in some cold dark cubicle with a crazy boss who couldn’t program a twenty out of an ATM, while some recruiter somewhere gets a $1000 bonus because she was better at negotiating than you were.” Even in the case of internships, offer deadlines need not be as aggressive as they often are, and I’m happy to report that many college career centers have taken stands against exploding offers. Nevertheless, if you’re not a student or if your school hasn’t outlawed this vile practice, here’s exactly what to say if it ever happens to you. I would very much appreciate having a bit more time. I’m very excited about Company X. At the same time, choosing where I work is extremely important to me. Of course, I will not drag things out, and I will continue to keep you in the loop, but I hope you can understand my desire to make as informed of a decision as possible. How about I make a decision by…? The reverse used car salesman… or what to say to always get more At the end of the day, the best way to get more money is to have other offers. I know, I know, interviewing sucks and is a giant gauntlet-slog, but in many cases, having just one other offer (so, I don’t know, spending a few extra days of your time spread over a few weeks) can get you at least $10K extra. It’s a pretty rational, clear-cut argument for biting the slog-bullet and doing a few more interviews. One anecdote I’ll share on the subject goes like this. A few years ago, a close friend of mine who’s notoriously bad at negotiation and hates it with a passion was interviewing at one of the big 4 companies. I was trying to talk him into getting out there just a little bit, for the love of god, and talk to at least one more company. I ended up introducing him to a mid-sized startup where he quickly got an onsite interview. Just mentioning that he had an onsite at this company to his recruiter from the bigco got him an extra $5K in his signing bonus. Offers are, of course, better than onsites, but in a pinch, even onsites will do… because every onsite increases your odds of not accepting the offer from the company you’re negotiating with. So, let’s say you do have some offers. Do you reveal the details? The answer is that it depends. If the cash parts of the offers you have are worth more than the one you have in hand, then you can reveal the details. If they’re worth more in total but less in cash, it’s a bit dicier because equity at smaller companies is kind of worthless… you can still use it as leverage if you tell the story that that equity is worth more to YOU, but that’s going to take a bit more finesse, so if you’ve never negotiated before, you might want to hold off. If the cash part of your equity is not worth more, it’s sufficient to say you have offers and when pressed, you can simply say that you’re not sharing the details (it’s ok not to share the details). But whether you reveal details or not, here’s the basic formula for getting more. See why I call it the reverse used car salesman? I have the following onsites/offers, and I’m still interviewing at Company X and Company Y, but I’m really excited about this opportunity and will drop my other stuff and SIGN TODAY if… So, “if” what? I propose listing 3 things you want, which will typically be: Equity Salary Signing/relocation bonus The reason I list 3 things above isn’t because I expect you’ll be able to get all 3, but this way, you’re giving the person you’re negotiating with some options. In my experience, you’ll likely get 2 out of the 3. So, what amounts should you ask for when executing on the reverse used car salesman? It’s usually easier to get equity and bonuses than salary (signing bonus is a one-off rather than something that repeats every year). Therefore, it’s not crazy to ask for 1.5X-2X the equity and an extra 10-15% in salary. For the bonus portion, a lot depends on the size of the company, but if you’re talking to a company that’s beyond seed stage, you can safely ask for at least 20% of your base salary as a signing bonus.2 What if the company says no to all or most of these and are a big enough brand to where you don’t have much of a leg to stand on? You can still get creative. One of our users told me about a sweet deal he came up with — he said he’d sign today if he got to choose the team he could join and had a specific team in mind. Other negotiation resources As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, there are plenty of blog posts and resources on the internets about negotiation, so I’ll just mention two of my favorites. The first is a riveting, first-hand account of negotiation adventures from one of my favorite writers in this space, Haseeb Qureshi. In his post, Haseeb talks about how he negotiated for a 250K (total package) offer with Airbnb and what he learned along the way. It’s one of the most honest and thoughtful accounts of the negotiation process I’ve ever read. The second post I’ll recommend is a seminal work in salary negotiation by Patrick McKenzie (patio11 on Hacker News, in case that’s more recognizable). I read it back when I was still an engineer, and it was one of those things that indelibly changed how I looked at the world. I still madly link anyone and everyone who asks me about negotiation to this piece of writing, and it’s still bookmarked in my browser. If you’re an interviewing.io user and have a job offer or five that you’re weighing and want to know exactly what to say when negotiating in your own nuanced, unique situation, please email me, and I’ll whisper sweet, fiscal nothings in your ear like a modern-day Cyrano de Bergerac wooing the sweet mistress that is capitalism.3 Footnotes Footnotes If you’re interviewing at interviewing.io, USE THESE ON ME.

Companies were pretty weirded out by the flat fee, so we went back to doing percentages, but these days we're moving over as many of our customers to subscription as possible -- it's cheaper for them, better for candidates, and I won't lie that I like to see that recurring revenue. ↩ Life is chaos and pain.

We dug into the data to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: October 13, 2022; Last updated: December 7, 2024Over the past few months, I’ve seen a number of fear-mongering pieces in the press about how the recession is driving tech layoffs and how tech employees (and engineers specifically) are losing their leverage as a result. The problem is that “tech” can mean anyone working at a tech company. You’re an engineer? Of course, you’re tech. You do ops? Great, you’re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn’t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It’s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that “tech” refers to engineers specifically. I don’t like imprecision, and I really don’t like fear-mongering. So, we at interviewing.io dug into the data to see if engineers do indeed have a reason to fear.Read more >The definitive list of companies who are hiring engineers right nowBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 20, 2022; Last updated: June 19, 2024interviewing.io is both a mock interview platform and an eng hiring marketplace (engineers use us for technical interview practice, and top performers get fast-tracked at companies), so we have some unique insights into how recent hiring freezes have affected engineers’ behavior. We also have unique insight into which companies are actually hiring. As such, in the spirit of being useful during a hard and uncertain time, we thought it’d be interesting to survey our users to see what’s actually going on in the market.

We surveyed 1000 engineers to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: August 1, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024It looks like we’re entering a recession. One of the hardest things about it is the lack of reliable information about whether companies are still hiring and what hiring freezes even mean. Arguably the two most impactful eng hiring freezes were announced by Facebook (May 4, 2022) and then Google (July 20, 2022). Facebook’s freeze is allegedly partial, targeting roles below L7 and excluding machine learning engineers. Google’s freeze is allegedly all-encompassing but may only last 2 weeks. But what’s actually going on?

We’ve seen the same practices with enough candidates, and across enough different titles and positions, that it’s become clear that they are not isolated incidents or a rogue recruiter’s doing but rather a consistent implementation of a deliberate strategy that comes from the top. If you’re negotiating with Meta, you need to know how they operate and understand the unwritten rules of the game. If you do not know the rules, you will fail — long before you even start negotiating.Read more >How to sabotage your salary negotiations efforts before you even startBy Aline Lerner | Published: August 23, 2023; Last updated: September 6, 2024At interviewing.io, we’ve coached hundreds of people through salary negotiation. We’re good at it — our average user gets $50k more in cash, and we have a 94% success rate. Having done this a lot, we’ve seen our users make the same two mistakes, over and over, BEFORE they start working with us. These mistakes are costly and make it harder for us to do our jobs. Both involve how you talk to recruiters at the start of your job search, way before there’s an offer. Even if you never use our service, you should absolutely avoid these mistakes.Read more >Exactly what to say when recruiters ask you to name the first number… and other negotiation word-for-wordsBy Aline Lerner | Published: August 16, 2018; Last updated: November 3, 2024There are a lot of resources out there that talk about salary negotiation but many tend to skew a bit theoretical. In my experience, one of the hardest things about negotiating your salary is knowing what to say in tough, ambiguous situations with a power balance that’s not in your favor. What’s OK? What’s rude? What are the social norms? And so on. Before I started interviewing.io, I’ve worked as a software engineer, an in-house recruiter, and an agency recruiter, so I’ve literally been on all sides of the negotiating table. For the last few years, I’ve been guest-lecturing MIT’s 6.UAT, a class about technical communication for computer science majors.

The sequel is fittingly called Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. We cover everything you need to know for today's tougher technical interviews and hiring climate. We have (at least) thirteen new technical topics and over 150 new problems. We’ve also drawn on a decade of hiring data and 100k interviews from interviewing.io to help you get noticed, manage your job search, and negotiate the best possible offer. The book is available now, and purchases come with $50 off on interviewing.io... given that it costs ~$45, it's not a bad deal.Read more >Why we’re pausing our Pay Later ProgramBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 29, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023We recently made the difficult decision to pause our Pay Later Program. In this post, we’ll talk about why we made that call and what we’ll be doing instead to ensure that engineers who can’t afford to pay for practice will still be able to get it. We’ll also explain some things we’ve learned along the way about funnel optimization, some mistakes we made while iterating on this program, and what we’ll do differently when we hopefully unpause it in the future.Read more >Building interviewing.io's collaborative & replayable whiteboard, or making systems design interviews not suckBy Shehbaj Dhillon | Published: September 6, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023During the spring of 2022, I went from being a user of interviewing.io to being one of the engineers on the team. I discovered interviewing.io in 2021 while preparing for my internship interviews, little did I know that I would end up interviewing for interviewing.io via an interview conducted on interviewing.io to receive an internship opportunity at interviewing.io upon passing the said interview. Yes. During my 11 weeks, I solved an important business problem, quadrupled my problem-solving skills, and collaborated with the fantastic folks who built the product made for engineers, by engineers.Read more >Announcing our Pay Later Program: Don’t pay for mock interviews until you get a jobBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 9, 2022; Last updated: June 20, 2023In the wake of COVID, I made a public promise to launch a program where engineers could defer paying for practice until they found a job. Today, we’re making good on that promise by launching our Pay Later Program! With this program, you get instant credits to spend on interview practice and then pay us once you’ve found a job.

This round of funding is a long time coming. I don’t know what the average company age is when successfully raising an A, but it took us 6 years to get here. It was a long and windy path, and for a little while, we almost died (more on that below), but we’re still here, and we’re so grateful and excited to finally have the resources to do what we’ve always wanted to do: fix hiring, for real. What does “fixing hiring” mean? We believe that the only way to really effect change, is to make …Read more >Announcing the interviewing.io Technical Interview Practice FellowshipBy Aline Lerner | Published: July 20, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io because I was frustrated with how inefficient and unfair hiring was and how much emphasis employers placed on resumes. But the problem is bigger than resumes. We’ve come to learn that interview practice matters just as much. The resume gets you in the door, and your interview performance is what gets you the offer. But, even though technical interviews are hard and scary for everyone — many of our users are senior engineers from FAANG who are terrified of getting back out there and code up the kinds of problems they don’t usually see at work while someone breathes down their neck — interview prep isn’t equitably distributed. This inequity never really …Read more >interviewing.io is finally out of beta. Anonymous technical interview practice for all!By Aline Lerner | Published: June 4, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io 5 years ago. After working as both an engineer and a recruiter, my frustration with how inefficient and unfair hiring had reached a boiling point. What made me especially angry was that despite mounting evidence that resumes are poor predictors of aptitude, employers were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously. In my mind, any great engineer, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to get their foot in the door wherever they choose. So, we set out to build a better system. On interviewing.io, software engineers can book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Facebook, Google, and others, and if …Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

A popular Reddit post suggests you need 700+ questions and a LeetCode rating between 1800-2000 to pass FAANG interviews. Is this really what the data supports? To answer these questions and more, we looked at our users' LeetCode ranks and ratings and tied them back to interview performance on our platform and whether those users worked at FAANG. In this post, we’ll share what we’ve learned.Read more >Are recruiters better than a coin flip at judging resumes? Here's the data.By Aline Lerner and Peter Bergman | Published: May 1, 2024; Last updated: May 20, 2024In partnership with the team at Learning Collider, we ran a study to see how good recruiters were at judging resumes. We asked technical recruiters to review and make judgments about engineers’ resumes, just as they would in their current roles. They answered two questions per resume: Would you interview this candidate? What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview? We ended up with nearly 2,200 evaluations of over 1,000 resumes. We then compared those judgments to how those engineers performed in interviews on our platform. Here's what we learned.Read more >Refuting Bloomberg's analysis: ChatGPT isn't racist. But it is bad at recruiting.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 11, 2024; Last updated: April 17, 2024Bloomberg recently published an article saying ChatGPT has racial bias when evaluating resumes. We re-ran their numbers and saw that they didn't do any statistical significance testing. In other words, there's no evidence of racial bias, at least not in this data set. However, ChatGPT has another kind of bias -- it drastically overestimates the value of top companies and top schools and does non-traditional candidates a disservice as a result.Read more >Want to work from home? That’ll be $46,282.By Elliot Plant | Published: February 14, 2024Software engineering jobs come with a lot of perks. But that doesn’t mean our jobs are perfect. Work requires us to commute, reduces the time we can spend with family, increases our stress levels, and forces us to deal with teammates we don't gel with. And sometimes we work for companies with questionable morals and use technologies we don’t enjoy.  For some of us, it’s worth trading cash for a job that fits into our lives better. But how much cash? To figure this out, we surveyed our users about times they took jobs with lower compensation, why they did it, and how much money they left on the table. We have the numbers!Read more >How hard is it to cheat in technical interviews with ChatGPT? We ran an experiment.By Mike Mroczka | Published: January 31, 2024; Last updated: May 6, 2024Does ChatGPT make it easy to cheat in technical interviews? To find out, we ran an experiment where we instructed interviewees on our platform to use ChatGPT in their interviews, unbeknownst to their interviewers. The results were surprising, but as a preview, know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately.Read more >When is hiring coming back?

But we’d like to brave the scathing mockery of the internets and try anyway! Our courage is bolstered by some useful data we have (both proprietary and gathered from the internet), which we’ll use to guess what will happen in 2024 and to answer the question foremost in many of our minds: When is hiring coming back?Read more >Why AI can’t do hiringBy Aline Lerner | Published: May 16, 2023; Last updated: March 7, 2024The recent exciting and somewhat horrifying inflection point in AI capability tipped me into writing this blog post. I simply don't believe that AI can do hiring. My argument isn't about bias (though bias is a real problem) or that it's technologically impossible. It's just that the training data simply isn't available. Most people believe that if you can somehow combine what's available on LinkedIn, GitHub, and the social graph (who follows whom on Twitter etc.), you'll be able to find the good engineers who are actively looking and also figure out what they want. This is wrong. None of those 3 sources are actually useful. At the end of the day, you can’t use AI for hiring if you don’t have the data. And if you have the data, then you don’t strictly need AI.Read more >Does posting Open To Work on LinkedIn help or hurt? A tale of two labor markets.By Aline Lerner and Maxim Massenkoff | Published: April 11, 2023; Last updated: May 29, 2023If you’re a software engineer who’s on the market, should you list yourself as OpenToWork? Does doing so carry a negative signal? And with the recent deluge of layoffs at tech companies, has the meaning of OpenToWork changed? TL;DR It used to be bad. Now, it's not. Moreover, it's clear to us that the people who were laid off in the 2nd half of 2022 and 2023 so far are great... and that, by and large, these layoffs were indeed NOT based on performance.Read more >Why you shouldn’t list certifications on LinkedInBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 14, 2023; Last updated: May 16, 2023People often suggest that interviewing.io should create a certification that our users can post on their LinkedIn profile, e.g., something like “Top 10% performer on interviewing.io”. Presumably, these certifications would signal to recruiters that this person is a good engineer and worth reaching out to and should carry more signal than where said person went to school or worked previously. I've always thought certifications were a terrible idea, and I’ve resisted building them. Now, we've finally dug into the data to see if my hatred of them holds water. TL;DR it does.Read more >Our business depends on having the best interviewers, so we built an interviewer rating system. And you can too.By Aline Lerner | Published: January 18, 2023; Last updated: May 2, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you’re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world’s best companies. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. To keep our engineer customers happy, we have to make sure that our interviewers deliver value to them by conducting realistic mock interviews and giving useful, actionable feedback afterwards. To keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they’re getting without us. Otherwise, it’s just not worth it for them. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In this post, we’ll explain exactly how we compute and use these metrics to get the best work out of our interviewers.Read more >How much have 2022 layoffs affected engineers vs. other departments? We dug into the data to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: October 13, 2022; Last updated: December 7, 2024Over the past few months, I’ve seen a number of fear-mongering pieces in the press about how the recession is driving tech layoffs and how tech employees (and engineers specifically) are losing their leverage as a result. The problem is that “tech” can mean anyone working at a tech company. You’re an engineer? Of course, you’re tech. You do ops? Great, you’re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn’t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It’s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that “tech” refers to engineers specifically. I don’t like imprecision, and I really don’t like fear-mongering. So, we at interviewing.io dug into the data to see if engineers do indeed have a reason to fear.Read more >The definitive list of companies who are hiring engineers right nowBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 20, 2022; Last updated: June 19, 2024interviewing.io is both a mock interview platform and an eng hiring marketplace (engineers use us for technical interview practice, and top performers get fast-tracked at companies), so we have some unique insights into how recent hiring freezes have affected engineers’ behavior. We also have unique insight into which companies are actually hiring. As such, in the spirit of being useful during a hard and uncertain time, we thought it’d be interesting to survey our users to see what’s actually going on in the market. TL;DR There are lots of engineers actively looking. There are also lots of companies who are actively hiring. Read the actual post to see the full list of 447 U.S. companies who are hiring software engineers right now.Read more >Does communication matter in technical interviewing? We looked at 100K interviews to find out. By Dima Korolev | Published: May 18, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023The interviewing.io platform has hosted and collected feedback from over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity. But how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that talk is cheap. Read on to find out how and why.Read more >We analyzed 100K technical interviews to see where the best performers work.

As it happens, we know where our users currently work – they tell us that when they sign up. Given that we have this data AND given that we know how well people do in their interviews, we thought it would be interesting to see which companies’ engineers are especially good at technical interviews. Our resulting top ten lists are in this post!Read more >The Eng Hiring Bar: What the hell is it?By Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 31, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023Recursive Cactus has been working as a full-stack engineer at a well-known tech company for the past 5 years, but he’s now considering a career move. Over the past 6 months, Recursive Cactus (that’s his anonymous handle on interviewing.io) has been preparing himself to succeed in future interviews, dedicating as much as 20-30 hours/week plowing through LeetCode exercises, digesting algorithms textbooks, and of course, practicing interviews on our platform to benchmark his progress. But this dedication to interview prep has been taking an emotional toll on him, ...Read more >No engineer has ever sued a company because of constructive post-interview feedback. So why don’t employers do it?By Aline Lerner | Published: February 6, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023One of the things that sucks most about technical interviews is that they’re a black box—candidates (usually) get told whether they made it to the next round, but they’re rarely told why they got the outcome that they did. Lack of feedback, or feedback that doesn’t come right away, isn’t just frustrating to candidates. It’s bad for business. We did a whole study on this. It turns out that candidates chronically underrate and overrate their technical interview performance, like so: Where this finding starts to get actionable is that there’s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they’d want to work with you. In other words, …Read more >We ran the numbers, and there really is a pipeline problem in eng hiring.By Aline Lerner | Published: December 3, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you say the words “there’s a pipeline problem” to explain why we’ve failed to make meaningful progress toward gender parity in software engineering, you probably won’t make many friends (or many hires). The pipeline problem argument goes something like this: “There aren’t enough qualified women out there, so it’s not our fault if we don’t hire them.” Many people don’t like this reductive line of thinking because it ignores the growing body of research that points to unwelcoming environments that drive underrepresented talent out of tech: STEM in early education being unfriendly to children from underrepresented backgrounds, lack of a level playing field and unequal access to quality STEM education (see this study on …Read more >You probably don’t factor in engineering time when calculating cost per hire. Here’s why you really should.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 24, 2019; Last updated: September 18, 2023Whether you’re a recruiter yourself or an engineer who’s involved in hiring, you’ve probably heard of the following two recruiting-related metrics: time to hire and cost per hire. Indeed, these are THE two metrics that any self-respecting recruiting team will track. Time to hire is important because it lets you plan — if a given role has historically taken 3 months to fill, you’re going to act differently when you need to fill it again than if it takes 2 weeks. And, traditionally, cost per hire has been a planning tool as well — if you’re setting recruiting budgets for next year and have a headcount in mind, seeing what recruiting spent last year is …Read more >Can fake names create bias? An exploration into interviewing.io’s pseudonym generatorBy Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 7, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023Hello everyone, my name is Atomic Artichoke, and I’m the newest employee of the interviewing.io team, having joined a couple months ago as a Data Scientist. Atomic Artichoke isn’t my real name, of course. That’s the pseudonym the interviewing.io platform gave me, right before I took my final interview with the company. If you’ve never used interviewing.io before (and hey, if you haven’t already, why not sign up now?), it’s a platform where you can practice technical interviewing anonymously with experienced engineers (and do real job interviews anonymously too). When it’s time to interview, you and your partner meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard (check out recordings of …Read more >There is a real connection between technical interview performance and salary. Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 26, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023At the end of the day, money is a huge driver for the decisions we make about what jobs to go after. In the past, we’ve written about how to negotiate your salary, and there are a lot of labor statistics and reports out there looking at salaries in the tech industry as a whole. But as with many things in eng hiring, there’s very little concrete data on whether technical interview performance plays a role in compensation offers. So we set out to gather the data and asked our users who had gone on to successfully get jobs after using our platform to share their salary info. With our unique dataset of real coding …Read more >Impostor syndrome strikes men just as hard as women... and other findings from thousands of technical interviewsBy Aline Lerner | Published: October 30, 2018; Last updated: May 2, 2023The modern technical interview is a rite of passage for software engineers and (hopefully!) the precursor to a great job. But it’s also a huge source of stress and endless questions for new candidates. Just searching “how do I prepare for a technical interview” turns up millions of Medium posts, coding bootcamp blogs, Quora discussions, and entire books. Despite all this conversation, people struggle to know how they’re even doing in interviews. In a previous post, we found that a surprisingly large number of interviewing.io’s users consistently underestimate their performance, making them more likely to drop out of the process and ultimately harder to hire. Now, and with considerably more data (over 10k interviews led …Read more >We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered. It didn't.By Samantha Jordan | Published: February 13, 2018; Last updated: October 1, 2023interviewing.io is a platform where engineers practice technical interviewing anonymously. If things go well, they can unlock the ability to participate in real, still anonymous, interviews with top companies like Twitch, Lyft and more. Earlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students, with the intent of helping level the playing field right at the start of people’s careers. The sad truth is that with the state of college recruiting today, if you don’t attend one of very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim. It’s not fair, and it sucks, but university recruiting is still dominated by career fairs. Companies pragmatically choose to visit the same …Read more >What do the best interviewers have in common?

However, despite the inherent power imbalance, interviewing is a two-way street. I wrote a while ago about how, in this market, recruiting isn’t about vetting as much as it is about selling, and not engaging candidates in the course of talking to them for an hour is a woefully missed opportunity. But, just like solving interview questions is a learned skill that takes time and practice, so, too, is the other side of the table. Being a good interviewer takes time and effort and a fundamental willingness to get out of autopilot and …Read more >We analyzed thousands of technical interviews on everything from language to code style.

Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 27, 2017; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you’re an engineer who’s been endorsed on LinkedIn for any number of languages/frameworks/skills, you’ve probably noticed that something isn’t quite right. Maybe they’re frameworks you’ve never touched or languages you haven’t used since freshman year of college. No matter the specifics, you’re probably at least a bit wary of the value of the LinkedIn endorsements feature. The internets, too, don’t disappoint in enumerating some absurd potential endorsements or in bemoaning the lack of relevance of said endorsements, even when they’re given in earnest. Having a gut feeling for this is one thing, but we were curious about whether we could actually come up with some numbers that showed how useless endorsements can be, and …Read more >Lessons from 3,000 technical interviews… or how what you do after graduation matters way more than where you went to schoolBy Aline Lerner | Published: December 28, 2016; Last updated: May 2, 2023The first blog post I published that got any real attention was called “Lessons from a year’s worth of hiring data“. It was my attempt to understand what attributes of someone’s resume actually mattered for getting a software engineering job. Surprisingly, as it turned out, where someone went to school didn’t matter at all, and by far and away, the strongest signal came from the number of typos and grammatical errors on their resume. Since then, I’ve discovered (and written about) how useless resumes are, but ever since writing that first post, I’ve been itching to do something similar with interviewing.io’s data.

In February of 2016, we published a post about how people’s technical interview performance, from interview to interview, seemed quite volatile.

But the problem is bigger than resumes. We’ve come to learn that interview practice matters just as much. The resume gets you in the door, and your interview performance is what gets you the offer. But, even though technical interviews are hard and scary for everyone — many of our users are senior engineers from FAANG who are terrified of getting back out there and code up the kinds of problems they don’t usually see at work while someone breathes down their neck — interview prep isn’t equitably distributed.

The pipeline problem argument goes something like this: “There aren’t enough qualified women out there, so it’s not our fault if we don’t hire them.” Many people don’t like this reductive line of thinking because it ignores the growing body of research that points to unwelcoming environments that drive underrepresented talent out of tech: STEM in early education being unfriendly to children from underrepresented backgrounds, lack of a level playing field and unequal access to quality STEM education (see this study on …Read more >Can fake names create bias?

Earlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students, with the intent of helping level the playing field right at the start of people’s careers. The sad truth is that with the state of college recruiting today, if you don’t attend one of very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim.

We regularly hear stories about college dropouts, who, through hard work and sheer determination, bootstrapped themselves into millionaires. These stories appeal to our sense of wonder and our desire for fairness in the world, but the reality is very different.

Even with increased effort and resources poured into diversity hiring programs, Facebook’s headcount for women and people of color hasn’t really increased in the past 3 years. Google’s numbers have looked remarkably similar, and both players have yet to make significant impact in the space, despite a number of initiatives spanning everything from a points system rewarding recruiters for bringing in candidates from diverse backgrounds, to increased funding for tech education, to efforts to hire more candidates from diverse backgrounds in key leadership positions.

I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about the other half? What about the interviewer? In the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. This stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the interviewer. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews.

It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity.

By combining these two steps you shorten the intro-to-offer by ~1 week and reduce candidate dropoff by 5-10%. It’s also a lot less work for recruiters playing scheduling battleship. Finally, Hiring Managers will, on average, be better at selling working at the company – it’s kind of their job.Read more >Technical phone screen superforecastersBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: November 25, 2020; Last updated: July 14, 2023“The new VP wants us to double engineering’s headcount in the next six months. If we have a chance in hell to hit the hiring target, you seriously need to reconsider how fussy you’ve become.” It’s never good to have a recruiter ask engineers to lower their hiring bar, but he had a point. It can take upwards of 100 engineering hours to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire. Visnu and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the onsite pass rate went back up, and interviewing burnout receded.

The results were surprising, but as a preview, know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately.Read more >The 3 things that diversity hiring initiatives get wrongBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 18, 2021; Last updated: June 19, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade. Five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies. We’ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs. For the last year or so, we’ve also been running a Fellowship program specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds. That’s all to say that even though I have developed some strong opinions about “diversity hiring” initiatives, my opinions are based not on anecdotes but on cold, hard data.

Anonymous technical interview practice for all!By Aline Lerner | Published: June 4, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io 5 years ago. After working as both an engineer and a recruiter, my frustration with how inefficient and unfair hiring had reached a boiling point. What made me especially angry was that despite mounting evidence that resumes are poor predictors of aptitude, employers were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously. In my mind, any great engineer, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to get their foot in the door wherever they choose. So, we set out to build a better system. On interviewing.io, software engineers can book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Facebook, Google, and others, and if …Read more >The Eng Hiring Bar: What the hell is it?By Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 31, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023Recursive Cactus has been working as a full-stack engineer at a well-known tech company for the past 5 years, but he’s now considering a career move. Over the past 6 months, Recursive Cactus (that’s his anonymous handle on interviewing.io) has been preparing himself to succeed in future interviews, dedicating as much as 20-30 hours/week plowing through LeetCode exercises, digesting algorithms textbooks, and of course, practicing interviews on our platform to benchmark his progress.

So why don’t employers do it?By Aline Lerner | Published: February 6, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023One of the things that sucks most about technical interviews is that they’re a black box—candidates (usually) get told whether they made it to the next round, but they’re rarely told why they got the outcome that they did. Lack of feedback, or feedback that doesn’t come right away, isn’t just frustrating to candidates. It’s bad for business. We did a whole study on this. It turns out that candidates chronically underrate and overrate their technical interview performance, like so: Where this finding starts to get actionable is that there’s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they’d want to work with you. In other words, …Read more >We ran the numbers, and there really is a pipeline problem in eng hiring.By Aline Lerner | Published: December 3, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you say the words “there’s a pipeline problem” to explain why we’ve failed to make meaningful progress toward gender parity in software engineering, you probably won’t make many friends (or many hires). The pipeline problem argument goes something like this: “There aren’t enough qualified women out there, so it’s not our fault if we don’t hire them.” Many people don’t like this reductive line of thinking because it ignores the growing body of research that points to unwelcoming environments that drive underrepresented talent out of tech: STEM in early education being unfriendly to children from underrepresented backgrounds, lack of a level playing field and unequal access to quality STEM education (see this study on …Read more >We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered. It didn't.By Samantha Jordan | Published: February 13, 2018; Last updated: October 1, 2023interviewing.io is a platform where engineers practice technical interviewing anonymously. If things go well, they can unlock the ability to participate in real, still anonymous, interviews with top companies like Twitch, Lyft and more. Earlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students, with the intent of helping level the playing field right at the start of people’s careers. The sad truth is that with the state of college recruiting today, if you don’t attend one of very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim. It’s not fair, and it sucks, but university recruiting is still dominated by career fairs. Companies pragmatically choose to visit the same …Read more >If you care about diversity, don't just hire from the same five schoolsBy Meena Boppana | Published: October 24, 2017; Last updated: June 20, 2023EDIT: Our university hiring platform is now on Product Hunt! If you’re a software engineer, you probably believe that, despite some glitches here and there, folks who have the technical chops can get hired as software engineers. We regularly hear stories about college dropouts, who, through hard work and sheer determination, bootstrapped themselves into millionaires. These stories appeal to our sense of wonder and our desire for fairness in the world, but the reality is very different. For many students looking for their first job, the odds of breaking into a top company are slim because they will likely never even have the chance to show their skills in an interview. For these students ...Read more >LinkedIn endorsements are dumb. Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 27, 2017; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you’re an engineer who’s been endorsed on LinkedIn for any number of languages/frameworks/skills, you’ve probably noticed that something isn’t quite right. Maybe they’re frameworks you’ve never touched or languages you haven’t used since freshman year of college. No matter the specifics, you’re probably at least a bit wary of the value of the LinkedIn endorsements feature. The internets, too, don’t disappoint in enumerating some absurd potential endorsements or in bemoaning the lack of relevance of said endorsements, even when they’re given in earnest. Having a gut feeling for this is one thing, but we were curious about whether we could actually come up with some numbers that showed how useless endorsements can be, and …Read more >You can’t fix diversity in tech without fixing the technical interview.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 22, 2016; Last updated: July 15, 2023In the last few months, several large players, including Google and Facebook, have released their latest and ultimately disappointing diversity numbers. Even with increased effort and resources poured into diversity hiring programs, Facebook’s headcount for women and people of color hasn’t really increased in the past 3 years. Google’s numbers have looked remarkably similar, and both players have yet to make significant impact in the space, despite a number of initiatives spanning everything from a points system rewarding recruiters for bringing in candidates from diverse backgrounds, to increased funding for tech education, to efforts to hire more candidates from diverse backgrounds in key leadership positions. Why have gains in diversity hiring been so lackluster across …Read more >Resumes suck. Here's the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 11, 2014; Last updated: April 10, 2024About a year ago, after looking at the resumes of engineers we had interviewed at TrialPay in 2012, I learned that the strongest signal for whether someone would get an offer was the number of typos and grammatical errors on their resume.

It’s a classic, and the main point is that good design should make everything painfully obvious to users without demanding anything of them. Resumes are just the same. Your resume shouldn’t make recruiters think. It should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less. We've said before that spending a lot of time on your resume is a fool's errand, but if you’re going to do something to it, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return.

We don't do it, despite a lot of our users asking for this feature. The reason I've refused to build them is because, simply put, resume writing is snake oil. Why?

A popular Reddit post suggests you need 700+ questions and a LeetCode rating between 1800-2000 to pass FAANG interviews. Is this really what the data supports?

In this market, many of our users are struggling with getting in the door at companies, so we ran a survey to see what’s worked well and what hasn’t, in today’s difficult climate. Not surprisingly, warm referrals are the best way in. On the other hand, agency recruiters are clearly the worst. But not all channels are created equal. Some, like recruiters contacting you, you have minimal control over, and whether you get contacted is largely a function of whether you have top brands on your resume or belong to an underrepresented group. With others, like reaching out to hiring managers, you are fully in control of your destiny.

It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity. But how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that talk is cheap.

This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews – 60+ technical interviews in 30 days.

I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about the other half? What about the interviewer? In the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. This stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the interviewer. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews. Maybe they have even done a few interviews! Consequently, there is a lot of bad interviewing being done. That needs to change.Read more >Why AI can’t do hiringBy Aline Lerner | Published: May 16, 2023; Last updated: March 7, 2024The recent exciting and somewhat horrifying inflection point in AI capability tipped me into writing this blog post. I simply don't believe that AI can do hiring. My argument isn't about bias (though bias is a real problem) or that it's technologically impossible. It's just that the training data simply isn't available. Most people believe that if you can somehow combine what's available on LinkedIn, GitHub, and the social graph (who follows whom on Twitter etc.), you'll be able to find the good engineers who are actively looking and also figure out what they want. This is wrong. None of those 3 sources are actually useful. At the end of the day, you can’t use AI for hiring if you don’t have the data. And if you have the data, then you don’t strictly need AI.Read more >We have the best technical interviewers on the market.

We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers in a way that no single employer does – if we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In a recent post, we shared how, over time, we came up with two metrics that, together, tell a complete and compelling story about interviewer quality: the candidate experience metric and the calibration metric. In this post, we’ll talk about how to apply our learnings about interviewer quality to your own process. We’ve made a bunch of mistakes so you don’t have to! It boils down to choosing the right people, tracking those 2 metrics diligently, rewarding good behavior, and committing to providing feedback to your candidates.Read more >Why giving feedback (whether it’s good or bad) will help you hireBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 13, 2023; Last updated: May 2, 2023Giving feedback will not only make candidates you want today more likely to join your team, but it’s also crucial to hiring the candidates you might want down the road.

Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you’re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world’s best companies. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. To keep our engineer customers happy, we have to make sure that our interviewers deliver value to them by conducting realistic mock interviews and giving useful, actionable feedback afterwards. To keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they’re getting without us. Otherwise, it’s just not worth it for them. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid.

By combining these two steps you shorten the intro-to-offer by ~1 week and reduce candidate dropoff by 5-10%. It’s also a lot less work for recruiters playing scheduling battleship.

If we have a chance in hell to hit the hiring target, you seriously need to reconsider how fussy you’ve become.” It’s never good to have a recruiter ask engineers to lower their hiring bar, but he had a point. It can take upwards of 100 engineering hours to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire. Visnu and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the onsite pass rate went back up, and interviewing burnout receded. We didn’t lower the hiring bar, though. There was a better way.Read more >No engineer has ever sued a company because of constructive post-interview feedback.

Lack of feedback, or feedback that doesn’t come right away, isn’t just frustrating to candidates. It’s bad for business. We did a whole study on this. It turns out that candidates chronically underrate and overrate their technical interview performance, like so: Where this finding starts to get actionable is that there’s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they’d want to work with you.

One of the things that really gets my goat is when companies build employer brand by over-indexing on banalities (“look we have a ping pong table!”, “look we’re a startup so you’ll have a huge impact”, etc.) instead of focusing on the narratives that make them special. Hiring engineers is really hard. It’s hard for tech giants, and it’s hard for small companies… but it’s especially hard for small companies people haven’t quite heard of, and they can use all the help they can get because talking about impact and ping pong tables just doesn’t cut it anymore.

Indeed, these are THE two metrics that any self-respecting recruiting team will track. Time to hire is important because it lets you plan — if a given role has historically taken 3 months to fill, you’re going to act differently when you need to fill it again than if it takes 2 weeks. And, traditionally, cost per hire has been a planning tool as well — if you’re setting recruiting budgets for next year and have a headcount in mind, seeing what recruiting spent last year is …Read more >What do the best interviewers have in common? We looked at thousands of real interviews to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 29, 2017; Last updated: July 14, 2023At interviewing.io, we’ve analyzed and written at some depth about what makes for a good interview from the perspective of an interviewee. However, despite the inherent power imbalance, interviewing is a two-way street. I wrote a while ago about how, in this market, recruiting isn’t about vetting as much as it is about selling, and not engaging candidates in the course of talking to them for an hour is a woefully missed opportunity. But, just like solving interview questions is a learned skill that takes time and practice, so, too, is the other side of the table. Being a good interviewer takes time and effort and a fundamental willingness to get out of autopilot and …Read more >People are still bad at gauging their own interview performance. Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: September 8, 2016; Last updated: May 2, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous technical interviewing platform. We started it because resumes suck and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle. In the past few months, we’ve amassed over 600 technical interviews along with their associated data and metadata. Interview questions tend to fall into the category of what you’d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role at a top company, and interviewers typically come from a mix of larger companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as engineering-focused startups like Asana, Mattermark, KeepSafe, and more. Over the course of the next few posts, we’ll be sharing some …Read more >A founder’s guide to making your first recruiting hireBy Aline Lerner | Published: April 26, 2016; Last updated: May 2, 2023Recently, a number of founder friends have asked me about how to approach their first recruiting hire, and I’ve found myself repeating the same stuff over and over again. Below are some of my most salient thoughts on the subject. Note that I’ll be talking a lot about engineering hiring because that’s what I know, but I expect a lot of this applies to other fields as well, especially ones where the demand for labor outstrips supply. Don’t get caught up by flashy employment history; hustle trumps brands At first glance, hiring someone who’s done recruiting for highly successful tech giants seems like a no-brainer. Google and Facebook are good at hiring great engineers, right? …Read more >Engineers can't gauge their own interview performance.

I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about the other half? What about the interviewer? In the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. This stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the interviewer. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews. Maybe they have even done a few interviews! Consequently, there is a lot of bad interviewing being done. That needs to change.Read more >Are recruiters better than a coin flip at judging resumes? Here's the data.By Aline Lerner and Peter Bergman | Published: May 1, 2024; Last updated: May 20, 2024In partnership with the team at Learning Collider, we ran a study to see how good recruiters were at judging resumes. We asked technical recruiters to review and make judgments about engineers’ resumes, just as they would in their current roles. They answered two questions per resume: Would you interview this candidate? What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview? We ended up with nearly 2,200 evaluations of over 1,000 resumes. We then compared those judgments to how those engineers performed in interviews on our platform. Here's what we learned.Read more >Refuting Bloomberg's analysis: ChatGPT isn't racist. But it is bad at recruiting.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 11, 2024; Last updated: April 17, 2024Bloomberg recently published an article saying ChatGPT has racial bias when evaluating resumes. We re-ran their numbers and saw that they didn't do any statistical significance testing. In other words, there's no evidence of racial bias, at least not in this data set. However, ChatGPT has another kind of bias -- it drastically overestimates the value of top companies and top schools and does non-traditional candidates a disservice as a result.Read more >My manager is not promoting me.

I'm really smart. I got a 4.9 GPA at MIT. By this time I had worked with a pretty wide range of different software languages, tools, frameworks, ideologies, etc. I had managed 30+ people and could also plan and build complex systems solo when needed. I felt very qualified for the positions I was applying for. On my first Big Tech Interview, I did terribly.Read more >The unwritten rules (till now) of negotiating with MetaBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 27, 2024; Last updated: February 25, 2025Recently, while helping our users negotiate, we've observed a string of aggressive, candidate-unfriendly hiring practices at Meta. We’ve seen the same practices with enough candidates, and across enough different titles and positions, that it’s become clear that they are not isolated incidents or a rogue recruiter’s doing but rather a consistent implementation of a deliberate strategy that comes from the top. If you’re negotiating with Meta, you need to know how they operate and understand the unwritten rules of the game. If you do not know the rules, you will fail — long before you even start negotiating.Read more >Want to work from home? That’ll be $46,282.By Elliot Plant | Published: February 14, 2024Software engineering jobs come with a lot of perks. But that doesn’t mean our jobs are perfect. Work requires us to commute, reduces the time we can spend with family, increases our stress levels, and forces us to deal with teammates we don't gel with. And sometimes we work for companies with questionable morals and use technologies we don’t enjoy.  For some of us, it’s worth trading cash for a job that fits into our lives better. But how much cash? To figure this out, we surveyed our users about times they took jobs with lower compensation, why they did it, and how much money they left on the table. We have the numbers!Read more >How hard is it to cheat in technical interviews with ChatGPT? We ran an experiment.By Mike Mroczka | Published: January 31, 2024; Last updated: May 6, 2024Does ChatGPT make it easy to cheat in technical interviews?

The results were surprising, but as a preview, know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately.Read more >When is hiring coming back?

We’re good at it — our average user gets $50k more in cash, and we have a 94% success rate. Having done this a lot, we’ve seen our users make the same two mistakes, over and over, BEFORE they start working with us. These mistakes are costly and make it harder for us to do our jobs. Both involve how you talk to recruiters at the start of your job search, way before there’s an offer.

I simply don't believe that AI can do hiring. My argument isn't about bias (though bias is a real problem) or that it's technologically impossible. It's just that the training data simply isn't available. Most people believe that if you can somehow combine what's available on LinkedIn, GitHub, and the social graph (who follows whom on Twitter etc.), you'll be able to find the good engineers who are actively looking and also figure out what they want. This is wrong. None of those 3 sources are actually useful. At the end of the day, you can’t use AI for hiring if you don’t have the data. And if you have the data, then you don’t strictly need AI.Read more >Does posting Open To Work on LinkedIn help or hurt? A tale of two labor markets.By Aline Lerner and Maxim Massenkoff | Published: April 11, 2023; Last updated: May 29, 2023If you’re a software engineer who’s on the market, should you list yourself as OpenToWork? Does doing so carry a negative signal? And with the recent deluge of layoffs at tech companies, has the meaning of OpenToWork changed? TL;DR It used to be bad. Now, it's not. Moreover, it's clear to us that the people who were laid off in the 2nd half of 2022 and 2023 so far are great... and that, by and large, these layoffs were indeed NOT based on performance.Read more >Why you shouldn’t list certifications on LinkedInBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 14, 2023; Last updated: May 16, 2023People often suggest that interviewing.io should create a certification that our users can post on their LinkedIn profile, e.g., something like “Top 10% performer on interviewing.io”. Presumably, these certifications would signal to recruiters that this person is a good engineer and worth reaching out to and should carry more signal than where said person went to school or worked previously. I've always thought certifications were a terrible idea, and I’ve resisted building them. Now, we've finally dug into the data to see if my hatred of them holds water. TL;DR it does.Read more >We have the best technical interviewers on the market. Here's how we do it.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 28, 2023; Last updated: August 27, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers in a way that no single employer does – if we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In a recent post, we shared how, over time, we came up with two metrics that, together, tell a complete and compelling story about interviewer quality: the candidate experience metric and the calibration metric. In this post, we’ll talk about how to apply our learnings about interviewer quality to your own process. We’ve made a bunch of mistakes so you don’t have to! It boils down to choosing the right people, tracking those 2 metrics diligently, rewarding good behavior, and committing to providing feedback to your candidates.Read more >How software engineering behavioral interviews are evaluated at Meta (from an ex-Meta manager)By Lior Neu-ner | Published: February 14, 2023; Last updated: April 28, 2025Hi, I’m Lior.

Most people overestimated the number by an order of magnitude. Here's what we did to get to the actual number.Read more >Our business depends on having the best interviewers, so we built an interviewer rating system. And you can too.By Aline Lerner | Published: January 18, 2023; Last updated: May 2, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you’re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world’s best companies. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. To keep our engineer customers happy, we have to make sure that our interviewers deliver value to them by conducting realistic mock interviews and giving useful, actionable feedback afterwards. To keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they’re getting without us. Otherwise, it’s just not worth it for them. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In this post, we’ll explain exactly how we compute and use these metrics to get the best work out of our interviewers.Read more >You now need to do 15% better in technical interviews than you did at the start of 2022 (and the bar will keep rising).By Aline Lerner | Published: December 1, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024interviewing.io is a technical mock interview platform and technical recruiting marketplace, so we have a ton of useful data around technical interviewing and hiring. One of the most useful pieces of data in the current climate is the ever-changing technical interview bar – throughout 2022, it’s gotten progressively harder to pass technical interviews, and it’s only going to keep getting harder. We crunched the numbers and came up with a running index that quantifies where the eng bar will be, as a function of open tech jobs. The bar is clearly going up.Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

We dug into the data to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: October 13, 2022; Last updated: December 7, 2024Over the past few months, I’ve seen a number of fear-mongering pieces in the press about how the recession is driving tech layoffs and how tech employees (and engineers specifically) are losing their leverage as a result. The problem is that “tech” can mean anyone working at a tech company. You’re an engineer? Of course, you’re tech. You do ops? Great, you’re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn’t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It’s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that “tech” refers to engineers specifically. I don’t like imprecision, and I really don’t like fear-mongering. So, we at interviewing.io dug into the data to see if engineers do indeed have a reason to fear.Read more >Why we’re pausing our Pay Later ProgramBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 29, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023We recently made the difficult decision to pause our Pay Later Program.

We’ll also explain some things we’ve learned along the way about funnel optimization, some mistakes we made while iterating on this program, and what we’ll do differently when we hopefully unpause it in the future.Read more >The definitive list of companies who are hiring engineers right nowBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 20, 2022; Last updated: June 19, 2024interviewing.io is both a mock interview platform and an eng hiring marketplace (engineers use us for technical interview practice, and top performers get fast-tracked at companies), so we have some unique insights into how recent hiring freezes have affected engineers’ behavior. We also have unique insight into which companies are actually hiring. As such, in the spirit of being useful during a hard and uncertain time, we thought it’d be interesting to survey our users to see what’s actually going on in the market. TL;DR There are lots of engineers actively looking. There are also lots of companies who are actively hiring.

We surveyed 1000 engineers to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: August 1, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024It looks like we’re entering a recession. One of the hardest things about it is the lack of reliable information about whether companies are still hiring and what hiring freezes even mean. Arguably the two most impactful eng hiring freezes were announced by Facebook (May 4, 2022) and then Google (July 20, 2022). Facebook’s freeze is allegedly partial, targeting roles below L7 and excluding machine learning engineers. Google’s freeze is allegedly all-encompassing but may only last 2 weeks. But what’s actually going on? To make some sense of a bunch of contradictory information about Google’s and Facebook’s hiring freezes in the press and on Blind, we decided to ask the people who, outside of Google …Read more >Does communication matter in technical interviewing? We looked at 100K interviews to find out. By Dima Korolev | Published: May 18, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023The interviewing.io platform has hosted and collected feedback from over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity. But how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that talk is cheap. Read on to find out how and why.Read more >We analyzed 100K technical interviews to see where the best performers work.

This round of funding is a long time coming. I don’t know what the average company age is when successfully raising an A, but it took us 6 years to get here. It was a long and windy path, and for a little while, we almost died (more on that below), but we’re still here, and we’re so grateful and excited to finally have the resources to do what we’ve always wanted to do: fix hiring, for real. What does “fixing hiring” mean?

By combining these two steps you shorten the intro-to-offer by ~1 week and reduce candidate dropoff by 5-10%. It’s also a lot less work for recruiters playing scheduling battleship. Finally, Hiring Managers will, on average, be better at selling working at the company – it’s kind of their job.Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

Five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies. We’ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs. For the last year or so, we’ve also been running a Fellowship program specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds. That’s all to say that even though I have developed some strong opinions about “diversity hiring” initiatives, my opinions are based not on anecdotes but on cold, hard data. And the data points …Read more >The technical interview practice gap, and how it keeps underrepresented groups out of software engineeringBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 9, 2021; Last updated: May 24, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade, and five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies.

It’s an interesting question, and one I’m sure many of you job seekers out there are wondering. Internally, we have our own beliefs, but we wanted to see if we could answer this question more objectively. So we set off on a journey to acquire data to try answering it.Read more >Technical phone screen superforecastersBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: November 25, 2020; Last updated: July 14, 2023“The new VP wants us to double engineering’s headcount in the next six months. If we have a chance in hell to hit the hiring target, you seriously need to reconsider how fussy you’ve become.” It’s never good to have a recruiter ask engineers to lower their hiring bar, but he had a point. It can take upwards of 100 engineering hours to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire. Visnu and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the onsite pass rate went back up, and interviewing burnout receded. We didn’t lower the hiring bar, though. There was a better way.Read more >I’ve conducted over 600 technical interviews on interviewing.io. Here are 5 common problem areas I’ve seen.By Ian Douglas | Published: October 15, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I recently conducted my 600th interview on interviewing.io (IIO). I’d like to share lessons learned, why I approach interviews the way that I do, and shed some light on common problem areas I see happen in technical interviews. Every interviewer on the platform is different, and so your results may vary. We have some excellent folks helping out on the platform, and have a wonderful community working to better ourselves.Read more >6 red flags I saw while doing 60+ technical interviews in 30 daysBy Uduak Obong-Eren | Published: September 15, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023What is the one thing you would look out for if you had to join a company? Sometime between January and February 2020, I wanted to change jobs and was looking to join a new company. This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews – 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. Doing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.Read more >Announcing the interviewing.io Technical Interview Practice FellowshipBy Aline Lerner | Published: July 20, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io because I was frustrated with how inefficient and unfair hiring was and how much emphasis employers placed on resumes. But the problem is bigger than resumes. We’ve come to learn that interview practice matters just as much. The resume gets you in the door, and your interview performance is what gets you the offer. But, even though technical interviews are hard and scary for everyone — many of our users are senior engineers from FAANG who are terrified of getting back out there and code up the kinds of problems they don’t usually see at work while someone breathes down their neck — interview prep isn’t equitably distributed. This inequity never really …Read more >interviewing.io is finally out of beta. Anonymous technical interview practice for all!By Aline Lerner | Published: June 4, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io 5 years ago. After working as both an engineer and a recruiter, my frustration with how inefficient and unfair hiring had reached a boiling point. What made me especially angry was that despite mounting evidence that resumes are poor predictors of aptitude, employers were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously. In my mind, any great engineer, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to get their foot in the door wherever they choose. So, we set out to build a better system. On interviewing.io, software engineers can book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Facebook, Google, and others, and if …Read more >The Eng Hiring Bar: What the hell is it?By Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 31, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023Recursive Cactus has been working as a full-stack engineer at a well-known tech company for the past 5 years, but he’s now considering a career move. Over the past 6 months, Recursive Cactus (that’s his anonymous handle on interviewing.io) has been preparing himself to succeed in future interviews, dedicating as much as 20-30 hours/week plowing through LeetCode exercises, digesting algorithms textbooks, and of course, practicing interviews on our platform to benchmark his progress.

In the past few months, we’ve amassed over 600 technical interviews along with their associated data and metadata.

Here's the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 11, 2014; Last updated: April 10, 2024About a year ago, after looking at the resumes of engineers we had interviewed at TrialPay in 2012, I learned that the strongest signal for whether someone would get an offer was the number of typos and grammatical errors on their resume. On the other hand, where people went to school, their GPA, and highest degree earned didn’t matter at all. These results were pretty unexpected, ran counter to how resumes were normally filtered, and left me scratching my head ...Read more >Lessons from a year’s worth of hiring dataBy Aline Lerner | Published: June 22, 2013; Last updated: May 2, 2023I ran technical recruiting at TrialPay for a year before going off to start my own agency.
