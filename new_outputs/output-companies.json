Do anonymous mock interviews with real Google interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.See available timesBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Google’s job interview process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers. All human organizations behave like a metaphor; Google isn’t a sports team, or a family, or an army. It’s a cool grad school. Larry and Sergey set up their offices based on the model of a Stanford campus on purpose. They wanted to create an environment and company culture where people can feel chill enough to talk about anything. In general, Google interviewers tend to be more collaborative than other FAANG interviewers. At Google, the slower you go, the faster you get there. Google has one big, centralized interview process that’s completely divorced from which team you might end up on, which means that you will NOT, however, be interviewing with your future team members – Google has a horde of interchangeable technical interviewers who have all been trained on the same process. If you do well, there will be a team matching component at the end.At Google, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently, which means you don’t get multiple shots on goal. Not only that, but Google has a limit for how many chances they’ll give you before you’re blocked from interviewing again. Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“You can interview three times in 5 years. If you fail all three times then you can’t interview at Google again: you’re blocked.”Note that recently, there have been rumblings of Google changing their process to something more decentralized, where a hiring manager chooses you for a team before you interview, nullifying the need for post-onsite team matching. As far as we know, this new model is being tried out right now, but the change hasn’t been adopted company-wide.Google also has rules for candidates who pass their interviews:Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“If you pass Google’s onsite, and end up not taking the offer, your “passing of the onsite '' is good for about a year. And if you choose to re-engage in that time, the process varies widely. Usually you can skip the phone interview. Most times you have to do the full or partial onsite. If you choose to re-engage, tell their recruiters ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get as many steps skipped as you can.”Google is not results-oriented. They’re process oriented. In other words, they care more about the “How” than the “What”. You’ve heard it before, and it’s true – they don’t need you to get to the optimal solution, but they do need to be impressed by your thought process. Because of this, Google is more attracted to comfort with ambiguity than speed.Oddly, in spite of using a centralized interview process, Google doesn’t have in-depth training for its interviewers; it may surprise some candidates that there’s a larger-than-expected number of bad interviewers at Google. Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“There is one thing that always bothered me about the Google interview process. And it's something that a lot of candidates don’t realize. There are a lot of bad interviewers at Google. Mostly because there are a lot of highly talented people who think they know everything. I was the interviewer for the third interview round at in-person onsite. And I saw the candidate was there by himself; the second interviewer wasn’t there. The candidate was alone because the second interviewer got frustrated – they thought the candidate wasn’t worth the time for an onsite, so they left early.”Anecdote from an Interviewer Who Worked at Google and Facebook“Google is more likely than Facebook to design questions on purpose to be tricky. At Google, sometimes this is intentionally disguising technical questions to look like X but they’re really Y. And other times at Google, it’s designing a technical question such that if a candidate doesn’t ask a particular question they likely won’t get the answer.” Step 1: Recruiter callPlease see the section above called “A note about recruiter calls” Step 2: Technical phone screenGoogle’s technical phone screen is a coding interview that focuses exclusively on data structures and algorithms questions. Your interviewer will ask you to write code to solve a specific problem.One idiosyncratic aspect of Google’s process is their insistence on using Google docs for writing code (versus other companies which tend to use tools like CoderPad). This can be a bit jarring for those of us who are used to writing code in an IDE that does things like auto-indentation, auto-complete, syntax highlighting, adding missing parentheses or brackets etc. Despite not using an IDE, your interviewer will expect you to produce syntactically correct code. This is really hard. Tip to get unstuckBefore your Google interview, you should practice in Google docs so you don’t forget to close parentheses or indent your code.That said, more recently, Google has started interviewing using an internal tool with syntax highlighting, indentation and brackets completion. Whether you get to use it or not depends on your geography.Step 2.5: (In some cases) Another technical phone screenThe second phone screen happens only if the first one did not produce enough signal to move forward. Perhaps you didn’t communicate your thought process well enough, your code wasn’t of good enough quality, or you weren’t fast enough – but it’ll be only one of these – if you struggled with two or all three, most likely you aren’t moving forward. Tip to get unstuckIf you do get scheduled for a second phone screen, push your recruiter to give you detailed feedback so you can do better the second time – nothing beats knowing exactly where you need to improve. You probably won’t get a response, but if you do it’s a large boost to your prep.If you get a second phone screen it will be very similar to the first in terms of structure and content.Step 3: OnsiteThe Google onsite usually includes 4-6 rounds. Recently, there have been some internal experiments with the format, but generally the rounds are primarily coding, and secondarily system design. Some candidates get a single behavioral round, and others get to skip it. The more experience you have, the higher proportion of system design and domain-specific questions you can expect to be asked.Google’s interview types in detailAs we mentioned above, Google is process-oriented rather than results-oriented. As such, communication during coding and system design rounds is more important at Google than the end result.Coding The most important rounds at Google are coding. In fact, Google is the only FAANG company that considers coding to be more important than system design. Google’s coding rounds are about complexity more than speed. Their interviewers are allowed to ask anything they want, so it's more likely you might get a question you’ve never practiced before. Google interviewers are more likely than any other FAANG company to purposefully design a question so it tricks candidates. For example, they’ll disguise a question to look like it’s Three Sum, but that’s a red herring – it’s not a Three Sum problem. It just looks like one. A lot of what you’ll see in the onsite coding mirrors what you saw in the technical phone screen. During the onsite, you may see your interviewer layer more complexity on top of questions – they’ll design a question where they plan for you to get to the solution, then when you do they’ll move the goalposts and say something like: “Remember that assumption we made earlier about \\[X thing\\]? Let’s remove that. How would that change your approach?”Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“At Google, I’ve passed more people that arrive at the optimal solution without coding it than I do people who arrive at the optimal solution and code it. The actual code you write is less important than the thought process.”Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“Google is highly unstructured. Everyone can ask whatever they want.”Even though they can ask whatever they want, Google interviewers have a question bank too, but the bank is much much bigger than Facebook’s bank and, like Facebook’s bank, it’s community maintained. Some interviewers never deviate from the bank, and others don’t touch it, preferring instead to formulate their own unique questions.. This speaks to Google rewarding the “how” (aka “how a candidate got there”) or their thought processes. It also speaks to Google rewarding comfort with ambiguity. Other FAANGs have specific niche topics they love hearing and talking about (such as “performance” at Amazon), but Google is more abstract. Google might love speaking about and asking about ambiguity more than any other FAANG.Finally, Google’s coding questions are never practical. They are always theoretical. They will never ask you to pull up your own environment and write a program. They will also never ask you to take a solution to a coding problem and apply it to a real world scenario. When prepping for Google, only practice theoretical questions. For everything you need to prepare for Google’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Google coding interview preparation resources\" below.System design The second most important onsite interview type at Google is system design. Again, they are allowed to ask anything they want, so don’t be scared off if you get a question you’ve never practiced before. High-level and low-level system design questions are both likely. Some examples include: Design a load balancer Design Facebook Messenger Design an auth platformGoogle system design interviewers also tend to design problems that include linchpin questions. These are questions where if you don’t ask about a specific aspect of the problem, you can’t really solve it. For example, an older system design question at Google asked you to set up a service in some foreign country, and in the prompt, the interviewer mentioned that you have a dependency on some third party service. The linchpin question to ask: “What’s the service level agreement for that 3rd party service?” If you didn’t ask that (or something like it), then you wouldn’t be able to effectively reason about availability, which you’d need to do in order to do well on the question. Tip to get unstuckTo avoid getting tricked, ask even more questions in Google system design rounds than you normally would.Behavioral The least important round at Google is the behavioral round. They have the easiest behavioral screen in FAANG. Plus, you might complete an onsite at Google without a behavioral round because they’re optional. It’s not clear which candidates get them and which don’t. This is another reason to not prep too hard for their behavioral round. If you do get some behavioral questions, they might be one of the following:Tell me about a time when you had a colleague who was difficult to work with.Tell me about a time you received negative feedback.Tell me about a time you were mentoring a more junior engineer and your feedback wasn’t getting through to them. If you were going to plan an offsite for the team, how would you do it?Google is also more likely to ask you reflective questions. Most other FAANGs stick to situational questions such as, “Tell me of a time when…”. Those situational questions ask you to describe a past circumstance or scenario you’ve actually experienced and are fairly straightforward to answer. Reflective questions, on the other hand, can be tricky because they’re asking you to reflect on, or speak to, something less concrete, e.g., “What do you think about setting goals?” The smart way to answer a reflective question is to re-formulate it, and then answer as if it’s a situational question. So, “What do you think about setting goals” instead becomes,”Talk about a time you used goal-setting as a time management strategy”, which you can now more-easily answer by describing a real experience and outcome, “The last time I set goals…etc”, as opposed to wading into theories about personal agency. “I think goals are cool and important…” might not get high marks.Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“To be honest, there was some cultural backlash at Google when they announced that we had to do these behavioral interviews. What that means is you may get an interviewer who has very little interest in conducting this type of interview. Which could go very good or very bad. I have some peers who think this should not be a part of the interview process. So they give everyone the highest marks, pretty much just to eliminate this category from the interview. Google is primarily engineers, and most of the engineers think that this is a bunch of HR BS. So they either just won’t accept any calendar invites they get or they'll just check the boxes.”How Google makes hiring decisionsMost of the time, the post-interview feedback process at Google is completely asynchronous, and interviewers don’t meet live to discuss hiring decisions. That’s one reason why interviewing at Google isn’t like interviewing with humans: it’s more akin to interviewing with a machine.Each interviewer rates candidates on the following seven-point scale: Strong No-Hire, No Hire, Leaning No-Hire, On The Fence, Leaning Hire, Hire, and Strong Hire.How this affects candidates is simple: a Strong Hire can get you an offer, but it can also buy you a second chance. If you don’t get an offer, but you get a Strong Hire from one of your interviewers, you might be offered one bonus interview round to decide whether you get an offer or not.That said, you don’t need to get a “Strong Hire” to get a second chance. Overall, if you showed enough signal to not-fail but not enough to pass, sometimes they will ask you to do an additional round. Tip to get unstuckIf you get lucky enough to get a round where you are really excelling, don’t quit while you’re ahead. Keep going. In that round, don’t just strive to win; strive for total domination.A “Strong No-Hire” bars you from interviewing at Google for some time. Reports vary here, but one of our Google interviewers told us that if you get a Strong No-Hire, you might be frozen out for several years. If you passed overall then you will move on to the hiring committee phase.Hiring committee review & team matchingGoogle’s hiring committee consists of four to five engineers and engineering managers who have not interviewed you, with the intent of making hiring decisions as objective as possible.Going into the hiring committee review, your recruiter will prepare a packet that consists of your resume, any notes from the person who referred you (if you were referred), your recruiter’s notes from their call with you, and all the feedback from your interviewers, from the technical phone screen to the onsite.Resume screening tipIf you’re told you’ve passed the onsite, ask if you can submit a more recent copy of your resume. Some Google recruiters will let your new resume be the only resume the Hiring Committee sees. Your resume you submitted for the online application probably wasn’t customized for Google, but what you submit to the hiring committee can be. When the committee meets, they evaluate all the data on you holistically, and they need a consensus in order to decide to make a hire.Other than hire/no-hire decisions, the hiring committee will also decide on leveling. Ever since COVID and the rise of remote interviewing, we’ve gotten more and more reports from users that they’re being down-leveled at Google. Apparently the rationale is that Google doesn’t feel like they get as much signal from remote interviews as they did from in-person ones, and as such, when they don’t get enough of a signal for a hire but too much good signal for a rejection: they downlevel – when you want to reduce the probability of a false positives for L5… offer L4! Engineers who are downleveled at Google accept the lower level offer a lot of the time, especially in the current climate. In some extreme cases, we’ve seen engineering managers with 10+ YoE accept an L3 (basically a new grad) offer.Once you get past the hiring committee, you will move on to team matching. The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. In the ideal case, your recruiter will propose a few teams that are actively looking for someone with your skills, and then you’ll meet with the hiring manager from each team to gauge cultural fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.That said, there are rare instances where a candidate will get past the hiring committee but then not find a team that they gel with. Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“Getting five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’ is most likely to result in a ‘No Hire’ decision. I have seen many cases where the candidates got five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’, and the recruiter gave them positive feedback too, but the candidate got rejected. In these cases, every person the candidate dealt with directly (the interviewers) were positive, yet the hiring committee (the only people in the process who dealt with the candidate indirectly) rejected the candidate.”Google coding interview preparation resourcesHere are some tips for preparing for your Google coding interview:Practice in teams; have someone make up a question. Then have them disguise it or plant a red herring in it (for example, purposefully have it look like Three Sum, but it isn’t Three Sum).Practice with someone who can change the parameters after you’ve solved the main question by saying things like “Remember that assumption X we made earlier. What would happen if we removed that assumption?”If you see a question online that has been marked as “Asked in a Google interview”, then it is not going to be asked in your interview, period. Google is very good at retiring questions that have been leaked.Practice without the aid of an editor or IDE: in a Google doc, on a whiteboard, or with pen and paper.In addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Google content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Google interviewers, long-form solutions to common Google questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Google interviews.Google interview replaysBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Google interviewers on our platform.

They’ve gotten very aggressive, and if you don’t know the rules, you will fail.Meta’s interview process and questionsMeta’s interview process consists of the following steps:Call with a Meta recruiterTechnical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)Onsite interviewsWant to know if you’re ready to interview at Meta? Do anonymous mock interviews with real Meta interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.See available timesBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Meta’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers. Meta interviewers are guided by the company’s current motto: move fast. All human groups have a metaphor they operate from. Meta isn’t a family or an army. They’re a well-structured Formula 1 team; they spend a lot of effort to put safeguards in place, and then they go pedal to the metal. At Meta, speed wins.At Meta, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently like you can at some other tech companies. You get one shot on goal every ~3 to 6 months, depending on performance.Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“If you pass Meta’s onsite, but don’t take the offer your status of ‘passed onsite’ is valid for a year. If you don’t take their offer and then choose to re-engage within that year, tell their recruiter ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get steps skipped because you usually can.”Tip to get unstuckWhen interviewing at Meta, listen closely to the subtle clues and hints your interviewer gives you. Meta is the only FAANG where you can’t become an interviewer unless you give good hints.Step 1: Recruiter callPlease see the previous section called “A note about recruiter calls”. Also read our guide to negotiating with Meta. It starts at the recruiter call.Step 2: Technical phone screenMeta's technical phone screen is a 45-minute coding interview that focuses on data structures and algorithms.At the beginning of the interview, your interviewer will ask you a question or two about your resume and recent work that you've done. This portion will take 5 minutes, and how you answer these questions doesn't meaningfully factor into the interview's outcome - they are just meant to break the ice and get you talking. The part that matters is the technical portion.After the intro portion, your interviewer will ask you two coding questions, and they expect you to get through both in 35 minutes. These questions will be LeetCode easy or medium difficulty.Meta’s technical phone screens are conducted in CoderPad. If you've never used it, you may want to play around in their sandbox and get familiar with their environment before your real interview. One specific thing about Meta's way of using CoderPad is that during the interview, they'll have code execution turned off - if you've used it before and are accustomed to testing your code during the interview by running it, you'll need to practice not being able to.Step 3: Onsite interviewsThe typical Meta onsite will consist of the following:At least two coding interviewsTwo system design OR product design interviewsOne behavioral interviewAlternate Process for E6 engineersThe process for E6 engineers, as outlined in the diagram above, is slightly different. There will be a Leadership Assessment interview after the Technical Screen. In this interview, the following topics might be covered:Your current role, responsibility, and scopeCross-functional partnershipsSituations regarding conflict resolutionSolution skillsHow to drive resultsThe onsite for E6 engineers will also be different. You should only get one coding round, one architecture round, one design round and then a behavioral round.Types of Meta interviews and what to expectThere are four main types of interviews you’re going to encounter when you apply for an engineering job at Meta – coding interviews, behavioral interviews, and either a system design or product design interview. Here’s what to expect during each of these rounds of interviews.Coding interviewMeta's process is highly standardized, so coding interview questions and themes tend to repeat. Coding questions are pre-approved, but that doesn’t mean the interviewers have no freedom.Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“Meta gives you the questions to ask or modify. But they don't tell you the answers in their interviewing wiki. And they let you design the path of the question: you get to ask your own twists and turns.”Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“There’s some variance with the interviewer, but usually there are 20 mins per question, and the questions are simple. They want you to get the algorithm fast, and implement the basic solution. The kind of bugs that can be acceptable are empty input, and out of scope inputs like empty array/null. But an incomplete algorithm at Meta usually doesn’t cut it. They want you to get to it and get to it quickly, and you can sacrifice making a little bit of a mess along the way.” Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“I think there is a rule that during the programming interview, interviewers have to ask two questions. And the questions have to be balanced. The first is more like a juicy question testing problem solving skills and you as the interviewer can permit some bugs in the implementation. The second will be easy from the algorithmic point of view but the goal is to assess how much the candidate can write debugless code and test this code perfectly. And if a candidate fails to solve both problems, even if they somewhat shine during one problem: it will be ‘No Hire’.”It's not that bugs are encouraged, it’s that they're the only company that's top-down directive is: sometimes, in certain rounds, bugs are okay. No other company does that. Meta relaxes the need for bug-free code so that candidates can code faster. Finally, Meta doesn’t ask dynamic programming questions and, in fact, those questions are banned.For everything you need to prepare for Meta’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Meta coding interview preparation resources\" below.System design OR product design interviewMeta hires two types (on paper) of backend engineers: System Generalists and Product Generalists. System generalists get a system design interview, and product generalists get the confusingly named product design interview (in most other contexts, product design refers to UI/UX).Which of these interviews you get is determined by your recruiter, based on your experience. If you have worked on a lot of product features, then you get a product design interview. If you have worked on high-scale distributed systems, then you get system design.The product design interview at Meta is similar to the system design interview but with some key differences:System design focuses more on high level architecture and scale, while product design focuses more on interactions between services. For example, the expectations for API design in system design interviews is just high level arguments/data passed, whereas product design focuses more on the details, i.e., a more comprehensive list of arguments and response structure.Product design focuses more on how and what data flows through the entire system, between each service.Data models are weighted much higher in the product design interview than in system design. The expectation is to be more thorough and detailed.Take a look at this video, by Meta, about the difference between these two interview types:Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“Product design is less databases, more data flow, more time spent on details of the API (e.g. parameters that will pass). System design is more databases, less API details, and more about scaling.”Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“Many people think Meta only asks high level system design questions like ‘Design Twitter’ or ‘Design Meta Feed.’ But that’s not the case. They also ask low level questions. In E6 or above interviews, you will most likely be asked ‘Design Redis’, or ‘Design Kafka’, or ‘Design Memcached.’ I’d even seen rare occasions where E5 candidates would be asked low-level system design questions; low-level questions are less common in rounds for E5 and below.”Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“You have to ask about back of the envelope estimations. A lot of senior engineers hate to do that. I hate to do that as well. It’s a waste of time. When I do the ‘There is a rule that I have to do this. But there is no point in doing this. Let’s spend 5 minutes talking about real system design. Let’s assume we have to scale our system from 0 to Google level and therefore estimations are just a waste of time.’”Tip to get unstuckAsk your interviewer: “Do you want to spend a few minutes on estimations? I’m okay with skipping it, but if you need to see it, then let’s do it. If we skipped it, one thing that might be a more interesting conversation would be spending a few minutes on how to scale this system.’”Tip to get unstuckIf you don’t know what to talk about in a E5 Meta system design round, talk about user experience. Go on about two choices you could make, then explain in depth the one preferred because it’d be a better user experience. It’s also common for Meta interviewers to ask you to walk them through a system you’ve worked on in the past, which is known as a reverse system design interview. Behavioral interviewUnlike technical questions, behavioral questions at Meta are not standardized: interviewers can ask you whatever they want. Behavioral rounds are of medium/low importance at Meta; they’re less important than technical interview rounds, but they do carry some weight. For the best summary of what to expect in a Meta behavioral interview, read this blog post by a former Meta engineering manager – in it he describes exactly how behavioral interviews at Meta are evaluated and also includes a bunch of sample questions.Here is a list of questions to get you started. Read the post to get examples of good answers (split out by the candidate’s seniority level!)“What project are you most proud of and why?”“Tell me about a recent day working that was really great and/or fun.”“Tell me about a time when you wanted to change something that was outside of your regular scope of work.”“Tell me about a time you had to make a fast decision and live with the results.”“Tell me about a time when you needed to overcome external obstacles to complete a task or project.”“Tell me about a time a project took longer as expected.”“Tell me about a person or team who you found most challenging to work with.”“Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker.”“Tell me about a situation where two teams couldn’t agree on a path forward.”“Describe a situation when you made a mistake, and what you learned from it.”“Tell me about some constructive feedback you received from a manager or a peer”“Tell me about a skill set that you observed in a peer or mentor that you want to develop in the next six months.”Finally, if you are applying for E5 and above make sure to have a couple of projects that lasted longer than one quarter – if all your examples are of smaller initiatives, your interviewer may walk away with the impression that you can’t handle complex projects. Also, remember to quantify the impact that you made by sharing specific metrics.How Meta makes hiring decisionsMeta’s candidate review and feedback process is usually completely asynchronous. Sometimes, they’ll do a live debrief but it’s rare. This means there’s a low likelihood for an interviewer to “fight” for a candidate. Socially influencing interviewers won’t go very far here. Meta is also the only FAANG that asks interviewers for a confidence score when filling out post-onsite feedback forms. As a result, the process at Meta can be more forgiving on failed rounds because a lower confidence score means a failed round carries less weight. Also, Meta is the only FAANG that directly asks interviewers about downleveling. Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“Coding is used to decide ‘Should we hire this person?’ System and product design is used to decide ‘How should we level this person?’For coding interviews, the interviewer says a binary score first: ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’. Then in the comments, they say how confident they are in that binary score. The ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ is an official metric, but the confidence score is not. For system/product design, the interviewer gives the ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ first. Then they say if the candidate should be considered for another level. So the final decision could be like: ‘No Hire’ for E5 with low confidence. ‘Hire’ for E4 with high confidence.\"In cases where the hiring panel is hung, it’s possible they may request one more follow-up interview to help them get more signal.Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“Interview feedback is discussed primarily by the system design and behavioral interviewers, and those are the interviewers who have the most say regarding both the hire decision and a candidate’s level. If interviewers don’t feel like they got enough signal and the candidate ends up being on the fence, the recruiter will push for an additional round. Indicative hint: If you have an additional follow-up interview, your interviewers were probably split.\"Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“At Staff level and above, it’s a mandate that candidates can’t get hired if they don’t pass both system design rounds.”Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“For E6 and above candidates, if you fail one system design round but do well in the other rounds, you can get a mulligan. They can let you retake one system design round. But the same isn’t true for behavioral: if you fail there’s no mulligan. If you fail the behavioral round, it will be ‘No Hire.’”'Team matching, offers, and “Bootcamp”'Meta made some changes to their process in 2023. Before, unlike at other FAANGs, you'd generally accept an offer before knowing with which team you'd end up on. Then you'd do a 6 week “Bootcamp”, where you'd be trained on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems. After the bootcamp, there would be a 2 week team-matching period.Now, after you finish the onsite, you jump straight to the team matching process. Team matching now happens BEFORE you get an offer, and offers are contingent on team matching completely successfully.You'll talk with hiring managers from a number of teams to gauge fit and chemistry: we've heard that sometimes it's a handful, and sometimes it's over 10.After your team matching conversations, your recruiter will ask you to choose a team. In order to move forward, both you and the hiring manager have to opt in.Once you make your choice, your recruiter will officially make an offer, and you'll usually have just a few days to make your decision. We hope this will change in the future, but recently Meta has been very aggressive with both offer timelines and with negotiations - they will not negotiate unless you can share competitive offer details from another top-tier company.One other key difference between Meta's new process and the old one is what happens during Bootcamp. Historically, Bootcamp took 6 weeks, and in addition to training new hires on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems, there'd be a multi-week “speed dating”-esque team matching component.Bootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter - 2-4 weeks, and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers will continue to ramp up on their specific teams.The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. You meet with hiring managers to gauge fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“When the market is good, you can talk to 20 different teams at the same time.”There are exceptions – some people with niche skills may get hired for a specific team before they start Bootcamp, but they still have to do the bootcamp period, just not the team-matching part afterwards.Meta coding interview preparation resourcesWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Meta content for you!

Amazon isn’t a sports team or a family; they’re a motley crew of Terminators. They’re a different breed with notoriously high standards. They reward aggression. And they want to take over the market (or the earth, depending on who you ask)...Amazon’s process is not centralized, and you can interview with multiple teams concurrently. To up your odds, interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.Amazon really loves their Leadership Principles (LPs). Amazon interviewers may sandwich LP questions anywhere and everywhere throughout your interview rounds: coding rounds, system design rounds, all rounds. In short, at an Amazon interview, be prepared for Leadership Principles questions anywhere, anytime.Finally, Amazon has one of the more-structured interviewing cultures. They’re the only FAANG where interviewers exist in a formal hierarchy, and Amazon openly encourages and rewards interviewers who reach the top rung in that hierarchy. In this guide we’ve compiled a comprehensive Amazon job interview prep guide based on in-depth discussions with Amazon interviewers and interviewees. Our guide includes a detailed walkthrough of the interview process, common questions and solutions, interview tips, video replays of mock Amazon interviews, and more. Want to know if you’re ready to interview at Amazon? Do anonymous mock interviews with real Amazon interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.See available timesAn overview of Amazon's interview process and questionsAmazon’s interview process consists of the following steps:Recruiter call OR online assessmentTechnical phone screen (if you didn’t do the online assessment)OnsiteWe walk through each of these steps in detail below.Step 1: Online assessment or recruiter call Whether you start with an online assessment or an Amazon recruiter call depends on a few factors:Are you a mid-to-senior engineer?Have you previously interviewed at Amazon?Have you previously worked at a FAANG?If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you will likely not have to do an online assessment, and your first step will be a recruiter call. That said, we’ve gotten some conflicting reports from Amazonians, and it may be that Amazon has more recently started using online assessments to test the competencies of more senior engineers as well.If you do the online assessment, here’s how it works. It’s a timed, asynchronous test consisting of several coding problems, conducted via HackerRank. These are usually data structures and algorithm problems of easy to medium-level difficulty, as well as some multiple choice system design questions where you have to select the design option that’s ideal in a given situation. If you do well in the online assessment, you can skip the second step, which is the technical phone screen. If you end up skipping the online assessment, the first step in your process will be a recruiter call. Please see the section above called “A note about recruiter calls.”Step 2: Technical phone screen Amazon’s technical phone interview is a coding interview that tends to focus exclusively on data structures and algorithms. Despite the focus on speed, Amazon interview questions may require a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.For these screens, Amazon uses an internal tool called Livecode, which has syntax highlighting for popular languages but does NOT have the ability to run the code. In fact, no code is ever compiled or run in Amazon technical interviews.Finally, there’s a 50% chance that your interviewer will throw in 1 or 2 Leadership Principles questions into the phone screen. They’re not guaranteed, but they’ll definitely come up during the onsite.Step 3: Onsite interviewsThere’s some variance, but the typical Amazon onsite, or in-person interview, for technical roles, will consist of:At least one behavioral round (this doesn’t include all the Leadership Principles questions peppered through the other interviews)Three coding rounds One system design round One hiring manager roundAmazon has a special type of interviewer that they include in onsite loops: the Bar Raiser. These are typically senior-level Amazon employees at the top of the formal interviewer hierarchy, and they’re the toughest and most-trained interviewers at Amazon. They serve as an independent and objective evaluator, asking follow-up questions, and ensuring that hiring decisions are not influenced solely by the candidate's immediate team or department. Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon“Being a Bar Raiser makes an impact on your promotion packet. Every L5 nearing promotion at Amazon, is encouraged to do the Bar Raiser training. It’s a big input to get to L6 or L7. Part of the promotion packet is: how are you demonstrating some of the Leadership Principles. And “Hire and Develop the Best” is one of the LPs. There’s a lot of work to do in hiring to become a Bar Raiser: you have to do a lot of training and a ton of interviews. Being a Bar Raiser carries a lot of weight at Amazon if you want to get promoted.”At Amazon, Bar Raisers and hiring managers are the only interviewers who have the formal authority to veto a hiring decision. You can recognize them because they are the only interviewer in your onsite loop who has nothing to do with the team you’re interviewing for. Bar Raiser rounds can be super intense, but don’t shrink when you feel a Bar Raiser throw flames your way; embrace the fire.The three types of Amazon interviewThere are three main types of interviews you’ll face as a software engineer interviewing at Amazon. These are coding, behavioral, and system design interviews.1. Coding interviewYou will have to do coding interviews in the phone screen and in the onsite. Coding rounds at the onsite are very similar to technical phone screen rounds, except that in the technical phone screen you might get Leadership Principles questions, whereas in the onsite coding portion, you definitely will.Amazon asks mostly medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions and avoids hard questions. The idea is to let candidates demonstrate how quickly they get to the optimal result, all in the service of hiring engineers who can churn out new features quickly. Despite the focus on speed, Amazon questions may be a complex problem that requires a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.Amazon’s coding rounds test the following technical skills:Computer science fundamentals and knowledge of data structures and algorithmsThe ability to write logical and maintainable code. These rounds require writing some classes and implementing some functions, e.g., “Implement some common functions of a file system”Although your performance in technical interviews matters (if you fail the technical, you usually will not move forward), it’s not as important as the outcome of the behavioral interview, and coding interviews during the onsite at Amazon actually feature Leadership Principles questions. Anecdote from a Amazon Interviewer“Because no code is ever run on an editor, the approach, speed, and testing are most important. Code syntax, typos, variable naming, and edge cases are less important.”Graph questions are among the most popular types of questions asked at Amazon, as well as tree questions that require BFS or DFS. Classic questions like LRU cache, meeting rooms, word break, word search, word ladder, and so on may also come up. We’ve heard from Amazon interviewers that all of the data structures and algorithms questions in Amazon’s official question bank are actually on LeetCode. That said, Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in coding rounds, and some will deviate from the question bank to ask more practical questions such as, “Implement a function with some behavior with the help of these two APIs…””Finally, like Facebook, Amazon shies away from dynamic programming questions (though they’re not banned outright).For everything you need to prepare for Amazon’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Amazon coding interview preparation resources\" below.2. Behavioral interviewThe behavioral interview is one of, along with coding interviews at the onsite, the most important in terms of leading to an offer.Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon“I’ve done over a hundred interviews at Amazon. The behavioral interview is most likely to get someone pushed over the line if they were borderline in their technical interviews. The opposite is not true: if they don’t meet the behavioral bar, we don’t care how they did in technicals, we aren’t hiring them.”Behavioral is an extremely important part of the Amazon interview process – Amazon is more likely to downlevel or reject you solely based on behavioral – and their behavioral round might be the most well-thought-out interview in all of big tech. It also might be the easiest to fail if you don’t specifically prepare for it. There’s no flavor like the flavor of an Amazonian behavioral interviewer; if you’ve never encountered it before and don’t expect it, it can be jarring. One of the most common mistakes our users make is not taking this interview seriously because at most other companies, behavioral interviews tend to be more lip service than a meaningful part of the process. The bottom line is, if you want an Amazon job at a senior level or above, you have to seriously prepare for the behavioral interview questions.Tip to get unstuckNot all Leadership Principles are created equal. Customer Obsession is the 👑one Leadership Principle to rule them all. When in doubt, demonstrate Customer Obsession. If you get a curveball, give an answer that shows you’re deeply committed to making things customers love. Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser“If you have a bad LP round, or if LPs are problematic in the debrief, it’s almost always a ‘no hire.’ But if you have great LPs then there is a conversation where we try to see if the candidate can be hired even if the technical rounds weren't at the bar. But not the other way around. But if there’s anything ‘at the bar’ or ‘below the bar’ for LP, then you fail.”Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser“If a candidate does not do that well on the technical round but they do well on LPs, there is always a possibility of recycling the candidate because they’re a good fit for Amazon but not good for the team. So sometimes we’ll help them interview with other teams, and they don’t have to do a full onsite: they just need to do 1-2 more rounds as a follow up. But if they’re below the bar for LPs, then they’re not a fit for Amazon so Amazon wouldn’t help set them up to other teams with shortened onsites.”In this round, expect questions from all 5 of these categories:Technical problem solvingLearning (and failure)Getting stuff (for the business) doneInterpersonal conflictAmbiguityHonestly, the best place to find a detailed question list for Amazon’s behavioral interview, as well as a bunch of other interview preparation resources, is our Senior Engineer's Guide to the Amazon Leadership Principles Interview.3. System design interviewSystem design and coding aren’t the be-all and end-all at Amazon – of course, you still have to pass them, but if your performance is borderline, doing well on behavioral Leadership Principles questions will take you over the finish line. In fact, interviewers will likely ask you 1-2 Leadership Principles questions in your system design interviews. Try to be efficient when answering LP questions in system design rounds. LPs come first. Finish them early so that you have more time for the technical question.Anecdote from an Amazon Interviewer“In many debriefs, I hear the hiring manager say that we can extend the L5 offer with the understanding that system design is not their strength, but it's coachable. At the L6 level, the system design bar is comparable to Facebook or Google.”Tip to get unstuckIf you’re in a system design round at Amazon, and you don’t know what to talk about, talk about performance. They want Amazon to be the number one customer of AWS. And they love to find engineers who understand and are passionate about fine tuning performance in the cloud. Amazon is more likely to ask you practical system design questions. For example, if you’re interviewing with a team who controls Amazon’s inventory management, they might ask you to design a piece of an inventory management system. Other common system design questions include:Design autocompleteDesign file upload/download to the cloudDesign searchThe design questions are most likely about designing well-known features, as opposed to a complete system from scratch like Design Facebook or Twitter. Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in system design, but a lot of interviewers fall back on reusing questions from Amazon’s question bank. For tooling in system design interviews, candidates can usually choose any type of drawing tool. Excalidraw is most popular, followed by Miro.How Amazon makes hiring decisionsAmazon has one of the more well-structured decision-making processes in tech: teams typically do a pre-brief (live meeting before the onsite), submit asynchronous feedback, and also do a debrief (live meeting after the onsite). They rely heavily on live discussion to make decisions. Notably, though some interviewers might be able to tell an outlier story of a time a regular interviewer out-argued a Bar Raiser, most of the time the interviewers go along with what the Bar Raiser says. Amazon interviewer’s grade on a 5-point scale: Strongly Inclined, Inclined, Neutral, Not Inclined, Strongly Not Inclined.The two most important interviewers at the onsite are the Bar Raiser and the hiring manager. At Amazon, all of the other team members involved in the interview could vote to hire, but if the Bar Raiser or the hiring manager aren’t on board, that candidate is likely getting rejected.Tip to get unstuckAt Amazon, identify the Bar Raiser (the only person whose work has nothing to do with the team for which you’re interviewing) and the hiring manager (if you don’t know who it is, ask the recruiter before the onsite or an interviewer if during the onsite). Most of your energy should go towards impressing these two people – since Amazon relies so heavily on live discussions to make hiring decisions, impression management is more impactful here.

Microsoft lets you interview with different teams at the same time; if you want to maximize your chances interview with several of them simultaneously. Microsoft’s process is mainly (though not fully!) team-dependent. That means that while you interview for a specific team, you may not necessarily be interviewing just with people on that team. For example, sometimes you might interview with the hiring manager for a specific team, and your other interviewers will be individual contributors from other teams.Each team runs their own processes, which can vary quite a bit from team to team as well. Sometimes Microsoft bakes a quasi-team-matching activity into an interview process: where a candidate can meet multiple hiring managers in the same loop. Another variation is some candidates’ first round screens are with a hiring manager instead of a recruiter.Step 1: Recruiter callPlease see the section above called “A note about recruiter calls”Step 2: Technical interview (phone screen or a Codility quiz)Microsoft’s technical phone screen is a traditional LeetCode-style coding interview, with technical questions ranging from easy to medium. Interviewers aren’t given a rubric. Some of them get training, others don’t. They have freedom to ask whatever they want and judge your technical skills however they want in this round. If you end up getting the asynchronous Codility quiz instead, you sign on and have to answer several algorithmic questions in a short amount of time. In some ways, this is harder than the technical phone screen with the human because if you don’t pass the test cases, you get filtered out. You’re judged on several factors including: test cases, correctness, and code quality. Step 3: Onsite The onsite format can vary per org, but it typically includes the following round of interviews:One behavioral round of behavioral interview questionsTwo or three coding rounds One system design roundOne domain-specific roundMicrosoft’s interview types in detailCoding This is the most important round at Microsoft.Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“Since most engineers at Microsoft use C#, if you can, you should use C#, Java, or Python in the technical rounds. This way, your interviewer will be able to understand your code better and may even be able to help.”Microsoft usually asks LeetCode-style medium-difficulty questions in coding rounds. Interviewers get to pick their own coding questions, but, according to interviewers, Microsoft favors the following topics (in no particular order):Arrays and stringsLinked listsGraphs and treesLeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft is also a helpful resource.Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“Tree questions are most popular, e.g., various types of tree sum, tree traversals of certain orders, subtrees, etc.”Dynamic programming used to basically never happen, but now it’s a little more common. When you do get dynamic programming problems, it’s usually the classic ones like coin change, stair steps, edit distance, and various types of counting problems.Tooling for coding interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many teams use Codility.For everything you need to prepare for Microsoft’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Microsoft coding interview preparation resources\" below.System design System design is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft, and it’s sometimes conducted by a hiring manager. One idiosyncratic aspect of Microsoft’s process is their penchant for asking questions about compliance-related topics.Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“My Microsoft interview was insanely easy. I tried to step it up when I started being an interviewer at Microsoft. But then I realized that's how it has to be. Technical is like 25% of it. It’s not a generic FAANG interview. It’s more about three things: a) ‘How well does this candidate know this system they’re going to be working on?’, b) ‘How do they meet the exact needs we have on this team?’, and c) ‘Do they understand the little things we value? Like compliance, manipulating data, data pipelines, EU data processing, etc.’”Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“Microsoft is obsessed with the details of compliance. I don’t think I have seen a system that is as set up for auditing as Microsoft. Employees are asked to log so much. There’s a centralized grid system which is built into Azure. All logs are to be routed into that. This allows for centralized log spanning and auditing. Which I have not seen anywhere else.”Outside of compliance-related questions, here are examples of other system design questions you might encounter:Let's go back in time, how would you ship cargo to customers? Discuss an approach that touches on availability, latency, reliability, communication, etc.Let's say we are interested in palindromes and we want to store them durably whenever we come up with them. Design a system that lets you enter a new palindrome every time someone comes up with one, and allows users to check if a palindrome exists in a system.Assume you are a teacher and you want to test students if they know the country names correctly. You are provided a list of countries and pictures. Design a webpage + backend API that mimics a test for students to evaluate their knowledge (this would be for a full-stack role).Tooling for system design interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many Microsoft employees use Codility Canvas or Excalidraw.Domain-specific round The domain-specific round is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft. Microsoft is more likely to do these types of rounds than other FAANGs, and these rounds can feel similar to system design but involve some coding. Usually, domain-specific rounds are customized to the domain a given team works on and dives deep into that technology. So, whatever area this team is in (cloud networking, big data, etc.), that’s what they’ll ask you about. On some occasions, Microsoft customizes a round to the candidate’s skills. For example, if you’re a backend engineer, they might ask you to design an API or design a database. They also may ask you open ended trivia questions about the programming language you are most familiar with.Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“Another thing that happens in these rounds is they’ll ask you to discuss a complicated problem you have solved at your job. It's good for candidates to prepare to discuss 2-3 projects in detail: how did they implement caching, deal with scaling issues, and so on.”Finally, you may get a scenario question that’s commensurate with your skill set. For instance, if you’re a back-end engineer, you may get a question like, “Imagine you're in a team and we're building a credit card registration system. And it's used by different firms. How do you build the interface?”Behavioral This is the least important round at Microsoft: the lowest effort way to pass is to not blame your teammates, not show red flags, and stay positive.Microsoft doesn’t have a specific set of traits they’re looking for. You can expect the usual questions about your strengths and weaknesses, failure, conflicts with colleagues, projects, and lessons you’ve learned from past experiences in your career. Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“A lot of people struggle with ‘What are your top 2 strengths and weaknesses?’ probably because they are trying to make up an answer on the spot. Good to prep answers to typical behavioral questions in advance.”Ultimately, they are screening for three soft skills: positivity, ownership, and communication. They want to hire friendly people who can do the work and not blame others. This is not Apple or Netflix, where they want a particular flavor of personality, or where they ask interviewers to hire candidates they’d like to befriend. It’s more neutral.Behavioral rounds can sometimes have a coding component as well. When this happens, it might be an easy/medium-difficulty 20-min LeetCode-style problem. How Microsoft makes hiring decisionsInterviewers grade candidates on different scales, depending on the team. Some orgs have an asynchronous feedback process, other orgs rely on live discussion, and still-other orgs do both. Some orgs have rubrics, and others don’t. Here’s how a rubric looks at one org:Junior: Has growth mindset, seeks to understand ideasSenior: Drives self development, models openness, failure is okay, open to different ideasPrincipal: Consistently challenges group thinking towards productive discussionMicrosoft coding interview preparation resourcesHere are a few more interview tips and resources to help you prep for a software developer or software engineer interview at Microsoft.Microsoft interviewers can ask whatever questions they want, yet some interviewers repeat questions, so LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft is somewhat helpful.Study up on the services the team you’re interviewing with uses.Ask your recruiter for specifics about your rounds. If you get nothing helpful, then practice practical questions, LeetCode-style questions, and domain-specific questions.In addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Microsoft content for you!

Do anonymous mock interviews with real Netflix interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.See available timesBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Netflix’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers. Every human organization views themselves as a metaphor; Netflix doesn’t view themselves as a family like some other tech companies, they view themselves as a high-caliber sports team (in fact, Netflix calls their employees a “dream team”). They explain this metaphor themselves in their infamous culture memo. Finally, Netflix’s interview process is decentralized and team-dependent. Moreover, you can interview with multiple teams at Netflix concurrently, which can help you increase your odds of securing a job offer.Step 1: Recruiter call Please see the section above called “A note about recruiter calls” Step 2: Hiring manager screen This is a 30 minute call. A former Netflix employee called this round “Very chill, especially compared to the onsite.” This round consists of bidirectional surface-level questions. The hiring manager will also be selling you on Netflix. Hiring managers doing selling is business as usual, but in this case, it serves an additional purpose – because their onsite is by far the most intense, they have to sell harder upfront because the onsite is a bigger commitment for the candidates. Step 3: Technical phone screen The Netflix technical phone screen is a coding interview that typically lasts 45-60 minutes. There is significant inter-team variation on what these interviews cover, and the tooling you use during these interviews also varies by team,Step 4: OnsiteOnsite interview structure varies from team to team, but you’ll have roughly 8 interviews focused primarily on system design, then behavioral, and then coding.Depending on the length of the onsite, Netflix recruiting may ask you if you’d prefer to split the onsite over two days, and we recommend that you proactively ask to do that, given how taxing the behavioral and system design portions are! Netflix is the only FAANG that routinely includes 1-2 directors in their onsite loops. If your loop has two, it’ll be one director will be from your org and another from a partner org. Netflix does this to reduce bias. One director may do a system design interview, and the other will do a behavioral interview.Tip to get unstuck“Don’t be thrown off by having to talk to directors. Just stick to the principles: when you speak about technical stuff you’ve worked on, focus on scale, availability, and security. When you speak about behavioral stuff: use shared ideas from their culture deck, take accountability for your wins and failures, and demonstrate metrics and impact.”Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer“The HRBP \\[which is basically a very senior recruiting function\\] and the director would typically focus on behavioral rounds. I have also seen directors spending time (30 mins) just letting candidates ask and clarify any questions that they might have regarding the team, Netflix culture, career growth path or any other aspects. So, a strong recommendation would be to be ready with your genuine questions list and get things clarified in such interviews. Candid conversation is one of the key values at Netflix and asking genuine concerns if any is seen through good lenses, as that establishes candidates' seriousness about the role to some extent.”Netflix’s interview types in detailCodingThe technical questions Netflix asks vary from team to team. Some teams don’t ask LeetCode questions. Other teams will ask medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions with a creative/practical twist.These rounds are going to change team by team, but the pattern we’ve noticed is that Netflix coding questions often come in two parts.Typically there is one question and, in scenarios where edge cases and tests are done early, say within 45 minutes, the interviewer may choose to spend some time discussing general large scale engineering concepts and distributed systems (like microservices, scalability, etc.). For instance, some expansions could be:A system design expansion on top of the coding question, such as a practical application where they ask you to apply the solution you just found to a part of their real-life systemA deep dive into a specific skill set (e.g., if this team codes in Java: they’ll have a round all about multithreading for Java specifically) For everything you need to prepare for Netflix’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Netflix coding interview preparation resources\" below.System design This is the most important round at Netflix. Coding carries the least weight, behavioral carries a lot, and system design has the most. Netflix system design rounds are highly unique and highly challenging. Netflix is to system design as Google is to coding; these technical interview rounds include the most difficult and bespoke questions.Similar to how Amazon loves Leadership Principles, Netflix loves system design so much they even throw it into coding rounds sometimes – first, you solve a LeetCode-style problem. Then they ask you to apply it to a real-world use case. That said, Netflix system design rounds are easier to prepare for if you know the patterns: Netflix loves scale. Netflix never wants to go down, and Netflix hates when things aren’t secure. Availability is super important to them; they want to ask and hear about tactics to scale systems, keep systems highly available, and maintain secure systems. At Netflix, you’re likely to see unique questions that you won’t get anywhere else, and the system design round is the part of the process that Netflix interviewers take the most pride in, so they make up hard, one-of-a-kind questions from scratch. Thematically, their questions are more likely to be focused on scaling. They also like to ask about security and availability. In fact, Netflix is more likely than the rest of FAANG to give you a system design round focused solely on security. For instance, you might get asked what you would do during a DDoS attack, and the entirety of the session will be spent drilling down into the details. And because they’re also obsessed with availability, you might get questions around backups and what to do if a service goes down. Moreover, as with their coding rounds, Netflix prefers questions with a practical application, and they’re likely to ask you about something they’re working on right now. If you research the hell out of their architecture – specifically the service that particular team is in charge of – and the other services this service interacts with, you’ll be in good shape.You’re also likely to see a “reverse system design” round, where your interviewer will ask you pointed questions about the systems you’ve worked on before, e.g., the largest scale system you’ve worked on, how did you manage it, how did you scale it, etc.Questions they most likely won’t ask are product-focused questions, such as “Design Spotify”.Tip to get unstuckLearn about Netflix’s overall architecture so you can a) speak their language, and b) build or speak of something similar (in the interview) that Netflix has already built but simpler. For the team you interview with: what’s their tech stack? What open source stuff do they do? With which other services might their service interact? That last question is most critical. If you can put forethought into how their current system works, you’ll have a huge leg up; then all you’ll need to do is discuss what you learned about their system to score a bunch of points with any of their interviewers. What tooling you use in these interviews depends on the team you’re interviewing with. Behavioral Answers to behavioral questions are almost as important as system design at Netflix. You’ll get rejected if you fail the behavioral screen.These interviews have a heavy emphasis on the candidate being a cultural fit, being able to work in a team, having curiosity, and being product minded, highly motivated individuals capable of driving products forward. A unique part of Netflix’s behavioral interview is the “Dream Team” interview. This is a slightly more intense behavioral round conducted by a director. The \"volume\" is turned up on all of the things you might see in a typical behavioral round at Netflix (scale, accountability, open communication about concerns, high risk and high reward.) Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer“Netflix doesn’t hire as much as other FAANGs, so they want to make sure you're a star. That’s what the ‘Dream Team’ interview is about.”One key thing you need to do before your Netflix behavioral interview is read their culture memo. Our interviewers tell us that if you don’t do this, you will fail the behavioral round.Anecdote from a Netflix Engineer“The culture illustrated in the culture memo is sort of accurate to how the culture at Netflix actually is, but the actual culture is less intense. Team members tend to get along really well. You don’t compete with others in your performance review like it is at companies like Facebook. We’re not ranked against peers, so people are more willing to help each other out.”Netflix will ask about impressive things you’ve done, as well as dig into your motivation (your “why”). This round will feel like you’re doing self-promotion. Typical questions will ask about your favorite project, latest project, and most significant project, as well as open-ended questions about what you’re looking for in your next role and why you’re interested in Netflix.Tip to get unstuckPromote yourself early and often in Netflix behavioral rounds. Promote yourself proactively. Metrics and impact statements are effective ways to promote yourself because they convey a sense of scale and complexity.It can be nerve-wracking to talk to a director for 45-60 minutes. It’s more nerve-wracking when, out the gate, they ask you to describe the biggest thing you’ve ever worked on. When talking to a director, it’s more important to have metrics and impact statements.How Netflix makes hiring decisions Netflix interviewers are untrained, their questions are unstandardized, their interviews are team-dependent, and their decision-making north star is “Why”. You can interview with multiple teams concurrently, effectively giving you multiple shots on goal.There’s also no specific company-wide scale for performance at Netflix. This is different from, say, Google, where all candidates are graded on the same “Strong Hire, Hire, Neutral, No Hire, Strong No-Hire” scale. Different teams have different processes, but most decisions are made based on live post-onsite discussions.Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer“Netflix hiring decisions are black and white: pass or fail. And then you discuss if you'd be open to changing your mind. The only difference between Apple and Netflix was how they defined cultural fit. Besides that the hiring decisions were made in the same way: informal, mainly based on live discussions, binary decisions, and striving for consensus.”Tip to get unstuckImpression management is more powerful at companies that do live feedback discussions. To learn more about impression management, check out the resources to prepare for Netflix later in this section.

Do anonymous mock interviews with real Apple interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.See available timesBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Apple’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interview experience.Humans in groups act out a chosen metaphor; Apple isn’t a sports team. They’re an army. Their army is made up of people obsessed with making great products. And they look to hire people who’ve embedded Apple products into their lives. Armies reward loyalty more than sports teams. Apple also has the longest tenured employees in FAANG (we're including Microsoft with FAANG for the purposes of this guide). Apple is decentralized and lets candidates interview with different teams concurrently; if you want to maximize your odds interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“I interviewed with like 12 teams. I got 2 offers. Along the way, I told one of the Apple recruiter’s I was interviewing for another Apple team and they shrugged it off; they didn’t care.”Apple’s interview process is more like what you might see at a startup than any other FAANG – from assigning which questions to ask to interviewer training to how hiring decisions get made. Significant inter-team variance is the norm, with each team essentially acting like a startup that’s coming up with its own way of conducting interviews.Anecdote from an Apple InterviewerAt Apple, there’s no formal interviewer training. It’s very ad hoc. Every team is different. There is literally no process. What each of the teams does is rely on one of their very senior engineers or someone very experienced. Apple has a lot of people with long tenures, like 15 years. One of my colleagues had been there for 22 years. At Apple, the more senior you get the more the team trusts you to come up with your own questions. So what the interviewers at Apple typically do: you come up with a question that's not online, and you make sure it’s relevant to what your team is doing. Then you pitch it to your manager or tech lead. Then you run with it. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“One thing not enough candidates know about is this: there’s no such thing as an Apple interview. You apply for a team. Not the company. When people ask me “How to prepare for an Apple interview?” I say ask the recruiter. Because they usually know what types of questions are asked. The recruiter spends 30 minutes or an hour per debrief where engineers are talking about the details about the code. So if the recruiter is paying attention or is at least a little bit technical, they should have a clue whether it’s LeetCode-style questions or embedded style questions. So ask your Apple recruiter a forced-choice question like, ‘Is this interview more X or more Y?’”Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“I was one of the people to come up with a take-home assignment for candidates. Which was my favorite part of the process at Apple. We were hiring people for full-stack but not just any full-stack – we wanted people who were coding in Python on the back-end and a particular framework on the front-end. We cooked up a take-home which was a scaled down version of what they’d be doing on the job: an internal tool built in those exact technologies. We gave them that take home and had them work on it for a week. Then we discussed it at the onsite where we’d live-debug it and talk about architecture. I really liked this ‘Try before you buy’ style process. Because Apple really wants you to be productive in week 2, if not at the end of week 1.”Apple is the most likely to shock you; they’re more likely to ask you something you didn’t prepare for. Out of all the FAANGs, they’re the ones you can expect to do something unexpected, and some of their tactics can seem mercenary. Apple is the only FAANG which sometimes has a process to cut interviews short if the candidate clearly isn’t meeting the bar – if you don't perform above the bar for the first half of the interview, they’ll cancel the rest. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“If by the fourth round, the hiring manager has gotten consistent feedback that doesn’t meet the bar, then they’d end the onsite early and reject the candidate.”Apple is not results or process oriented. They’re motivation oriented. In other words, they care more about the “Why” than the “What” or the “How”, and as such, they value behavioral interviews more than coding.Apple employees are obsessed with privacy. It’s not just marketing lip service. When asked if “privacy” is a buzzword at Apple, our interviewers said…Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“Privacy isn't just a buzzword. We are obsessed with it. To drive that part home. Because it’s so important. And as I mentioned, I was a part of a group focused on gathering user data - users here being Apple internal employees – to inform future products. Even at Apple, when we’re just getting data from internal employees, we anonymized the data. Just to practice what we preach. Privacy is huge. Another example to illustrate that is that people get fired for torrenting music.”Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“Unless you’re interviewing for a security role, very rarely. Technical people at Apple are hired to do what they do best. They have a whole army of compliance folks and lawyers to take care of that stuff. They also have an internal police force called “InfoSec”, which is the team which takes care of the secrecy stuff. Engineers are needed to do what they were hired to do: engineering.”Step 1: Recruiter call Please see the section above called “A note about recruiter calls” for what to expect. We do encourage you to ask your recruiter what to expect for the rest of the process because as you’ll see, there is a lot of variance from team to team.Tip to get unstuck“Ask your Apple recruiter forced choice questions with two options, such as, ‘Is this coding round more of a typical LeetCode round, or more of a domain-specific open ended deep dive into a specific technology?’”Step 2: Technical phone interviewLike everything else at Apple, the format and technical questions presented in Apple phone screens can vary a ton. Verify this by asking your recruiter! Technical phone screens are coding interviews that range from 30 minutes to an hour. This tech interview may be between you and a single interviewer or sometimes a panel of interviewers. It may even be a hiring manager screen with a mix of behavioral questions and coding.In any case, the general format is a shared coding environment where the interviewer(s) can assess your ability to utilize basic data structures and algorithms concepts. Being able to provide a solution for coding questions and quickly analyze the runtime complexity of your solution are key skills to have going into this interview.The tooling used in Apple’s technical interview rounds depends on the team you’re interviewing with, but we’ve heard that some teams use CoderPad.(In some cases) Step 2.5: Take-home assignmentSome teams give candidates a take-home assignment. They can give this around the same time they schedule a phone screen. The hiring manager is usually the person to decide whether or not candidates get one. Step 3: OnsiteThere will be roughly six to eight in-person rounds of interviews, each of which will be with your future teammates. Each round will have least one, or possibly two, interviewers.Note that an onsite loop with one team at Apple will look very different than an onsite loop with another. Apple’s interview types in detailInterviewers can ask whatever behavioral, coding, or system design questions they want; there is no standardization for Apple interview questions. However, before an interview loop takes place, some teams will do a quick, informal assignment of what kinds of questions each interviewer is supposed to ask so that they don’t all end up asking the same things. Moreover, Apple interviewers are untrained, and as soon as a senior engineer is hired they can start conducting interviews. Apple’s unpredictable nature makes it so some of their interview rounds can’t be categorized into behavioral, coding, or system design. Is a philosophical question about products a behavioral question? Not really. But they might ask one in a behavioral round. Are rapid fire infrastructure-focused open-ended trivia questions more system design or coding? It depends. For example, here’s how one Apple interviewer describes the behind-the-scenes top-down directive before an upcoming onsite. “Go find a question that would be a good one to ask for our team.” That interviewer then ran it up the chain to an engineer above them. Then, that question immediately got asked in the next interview. At Apple, each interview loop is specific to the needs of individual hiring managers – there is no canonical “Apple interview”, and everything is “made to order” for each specific team. That makes it difficult for candidates to prepare.CodingSome teams at Apple prefer practical rounds. Sometimes, they’ll have you write a program on your own laptop and IDE. Other times, they’ll spend the whole round deep diving into a specific technology/use case that’s relevant for their team. For example, a team that wrote in Java and did a lot of work with concurrency had a whole round focused on concurrency in Java!Other teams do medium-ish LeetCode-style questions. At the end of the day, these interviews vary so widely it’s hard to give a specific directive, other than: ask your recruiter. For senior and above candidates, it’s more about demonstrating competence rather than needing to ace the question.For everything you need to prepare for Apple’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Apple coding interview preparation resources\" below.System designApple interviewers tend to ask questions relevant to a specific team’s work. For instance, a team focused on building web services will tend to ask questions about that, while front-end teams may ask UI-related questions. It may be good to try to get a feel for the day-to-day work from the recruiter/hiring manager, as the job descriptions are not always the most helpful (remember: privacy!). Tip to get unstuckIn system design rounds, Apple interviewers love to hear about reliability. If you don’t know what else to talk about, dig into reliability. BehavioralApple’s most important round is usually behavioral or system design. Behavioral rounds are more important than coding rounds. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“In behavioral, you gotta be a rockstar. You gotta be a leader. If you’re abrasive, or if you’re not a cultural fit, how are you going to lead the juniors? And system design is going to weigh a little more than behavioral. If you can’t code or if you’re a little rusty –if you’re good at system design and behavioral–we’ll forgive the subpar coding rounds.”An interesting paradox at Apple is: they highly value behavioral rounds but they don’t have a standardized way to assess candidates in those interviewsAnecdote from an Apple Interviewer“Towards the end of my career at Apple, we had a huge need for mobile developers. People who were able to do iOS apps. I was part of an R&D team. We mainly built web products in the beginning, but towards the end of my career we started doing more mobile stuff. We didn't want to hire someone who could only do mobile. We wanted someone who would be half as good at mobile stuff and half as good at web stuff, so they could plug themselves in anywhere. If the interview process was standardized across the whole company - you can imagine how hard that would be to test specifically for the niche skill set we needed. Within two days we cooked up a whole new homework assignment just for the ios candidates, we cooked up a whole new set of interview questions. We kept the behavioral part the same. But the technical part - we flipped it over just like that. And it was really good. We changed the way we graded, we were able to filter candidates based on the new set of questions. It was just fast. We didn't get any pushback from HR. We didn't have to work with compliance. We just did it. Really fast. Really nimble.”Because Apple doesn’t standardize their interviews, they’re particularly prone to bias. Sometimes the top down guidance to Apple interviewers is something like: “In the behavioral round, just see if you like them. See if you’d like to get a beer with them.”Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“\\[Interviews are never standardized.\\] And i’ll tell you why. Apple is a very secretive company. Everything is on a need to know basis. Also, it's a hugely political place. It was good for me because I understood the game. I didn’t blame the players I played the game. For those who understand the intricacies of politics, and simply accept the fact that it will happen when you have all Type-A people being paid a tremendous amount of money to do shitty little things, it's bound to happen. You have to accept it or you’re not going to play the game. Everything at Apple is very siloed. Even when it comes down to the cost center. Everything is super independent of one another. That's actually one of the strengths and weaknesses of Apple. We double effort for sure. But that doesn't matter to Tim Cook. They have billions of dollars to afford this – not a problem. I also really liked how it was siloed because teams and their priorities change, leadership changes, a lot of things change. Being able to decouple from the greater company enabled them to become one of the biggest, if not the biggest tech company in the world.”Even if rounds aren’t standardized, you will definitely be asked “Why Apple?”, and your answer needs to be on point. Some interviewers reject candidates solely for not having a good answer to this question. “Why Apple?” isn’t always a single question; they can spread this out into multiple questions and drill down on this for a good portion of a behavioral round. You can also expect other motivation-based (or “why”) questions. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“A common red flag is giving generic answers to the ‘Why Apple?’ questions. If I didn't feel their passion or if they’re just treating Apple as another job, that’s usually a red flag for me regardless of their technical competence. They really have to somehow convince me – and this is an emotional response they have to bring out of me – they really have to convince me they really want to work at Apple, they really want to roll up their sleeves, and they really believe in our values: delighting the customer, sweating the details. Making awesome products… We only care about that. We don't care about anything else. That emotional response has to be drawn from me and if they don’t then I’m likely to say, ‘They were good but meh.’”Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“I can tell you about a great answer one candidate had for ‘Why Apple?”. He said something like… His wife and him were university students dating across two continents. This person said they shared a recent feature – I think it was like when you facetime and you can watch video in sync – he shared how that changed his life. His wife and him went through the whole international relationship because of that. That significantly helped their relationship.”Apple wants to hire candidates whose lives have integrated with the Apple products. And the reverse is true too. It's a fatal flaw to say, “I've never used an iPhone or a Macbook or an iPad” because those people clearly haven’t integrated Apple products deeply in their lives. Apple knows what they like, and they like their products! That doesn’t mean all you have to do is gush about the products to pass the behavioral round. It means you have to tell a genuine story which connects you and Apple products or services. Ideally, a story they will remember.Another behavioral factor debated among Apple interviewers is whether or not they agree with the idea that Apple is “cult-ish.”Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“Apple cares most about the ‘Why’. You see that rooted deeply in every apple person's DNA. ‘Why Apple?’ Right? I guess this is where people get this notion of Apple being a ‘cult-ish’ company. Much like Tesla, actually. They have a huge customer following, but you also see the same pattern with their employees. Actually, I totally subscribe to this ideology. Because you want a person you work with day in and day out to have that same passion. Sometimes you're going to have to work overtime. You're not going to get paid extra for that. Sometimes you're going to work weekends. Sometimes shit’s gonna hit the fan. You don't want to work with someone who whines about it. Our theory is that Apple is more likely to reward employees (and candidates) who act like the leader. If you listen to 1:00:36 - 1:02:05 in an interview with Steve Jobs, you’ll see some stark similarities to how Apple interviewers talk about the organization. In this clip, he says, “You know how many committees we have? None. We are organized like a startup.” He then describes the benefits of silos and dividing things up.Privacy and politics are the natural consequence of a place intentionally designed to be siloed and divided up and kept separate. It’s a cost that Apple accepts because the gain is increased productivity. Put people in closed systems (teams and orgs that don’t talk to other teams and orgs) and watch them get more done. This system works like blinders on a racehorse: it keeps vision focused down the track, on the goal, minimizing peripheral distraction. That’s all they need to see and they run/work faster because of it.One final aspect of Apple’s behavioral rounds is that they will ask you specific questions about relevant skills. For example, if a team works with big data, they will ask specifically about a time you have worked with large-scale distributed systems in the context of your answer. If you don’t have direct experience with the field, they will try to get as close as possible, like asking you for what tradeoffs you’ve made when choosing a storage system. These behavioral interview questions serve two purposes: showing you have had relevant experience in the context of what the team is hiring for and trying to get you to talk about a particular behavioral skill (e.g., leadership, conflict resolution).How Apple makes hiring decisionsAs evidenced by the highest chaos score, Apple doesn’t do many things in hiring consistently, across the whole company. One trend is that Apple teams rely on post-interview live discussions to make hiring decisions. This varies from somewhat informal (compared to the rest of FAANG) to laughably informal. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“Post-onsite feedback for my org was 100% live discussions. At Apple I never had to write feedback. Which made me do more interviews. We made the decision on the same day. Everyone had to make a decision at the end of the day. Do an onsite, then at 5pm, we gather in a single meeting room, we do on the count of three: thumbs up, down, or in the middle. Then we talk after seeing the thumbs. And try to convince the people on the other side. If there’s less than 5 thumbs-up, then that might be an instant rejection. If there’s 6 or 7 or more thumbs up, the ‘thumbs up’ people try to convince the other side. Or in that same situation, the 3 or 4 thumbs down will try to convince the other side.”Because of the informal decision-making process and reliance on live discussion, managing the impressions of your interviewers is more important at Apple than at other FAANG. In these decision-making meetings, if there’s dissent, they strive for consensus. The people on one side try to convince the other side. This process can last 15-30 minutes on average; all FAANG companies say interviewers fight for candidates, but Apple tends to fight more than most of them.Because of their patterns of live-discussions and striving for consensus, Apple interviewers are more likely to fight for or against you (if your performance was on the fence) than any other FAANG, except maybe Netflix. Ultimately, the hiring manager for that particular role has the most say, which means that that’s the person you should be working to impress the most.Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“My manager wanted to hire this person. But he failed my interview so badly. I didn't want to argue with my manager but at the same time I didn't want to work with this person. Because we are hiring people we’d work with on a daily basis. So arguments happen a lot. And in this case, I was the only ‘no’ on the board and the candidate got rejected.”Apple coding interview preparation resourcesWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Apple content for you!

Amazon isn’t a sports team or a family; they’re a motley crew of Terminators. They’re a different breed with notoriously high standards. They reward aggression. And they want to take over the market (or the earth, depending on who you ask)...Amazon’s process is not centralized, and you can interview with multiple teams concurrently. To up your odds, interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for.Amazon really loves their Leadership Principles (LPs). Amazon interviewers may sandwich LP questions anywhere and everywhere throughout your interview rounds: coding rounds, system design rounds, all rounds. In short, at an Amazon interview, be prepared for Leadership Principles questions anywhere, anytime.Finally, Amazon has one of the more-structured interviewing cultures. They’re the only FAANG where interviewers exist in a formal hierarchy, and Amazon openly encourages and rewards interviewers who reach the top rung in that hierarchy. In this guide we’ve compiled a comprehensive Amazon job interview prep guide based on in-depth discussions with Amazon interviewers and interviewees. Our guide includes a detailed walkthrough of the interview process, common questions and solutions, interview tips, video replays of mock Amazon interviews, and more. Want to know if you’re ready to interview at Amazon? Do anonymous mock interviews with real Amazon interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.See available timesAn overview of Amazon's interview process and questionsAmazon’s interview process consists of the following steps:Recruiter call OR online assessmentTechnical phone screen (if you didn’t do the online assessment)OnsiteWe walk through each of these steps in detail below.Step 1: Online assessment or recruiter call Whether you start with an online assessment or an Amazon recruiter call depends on a few factors:Are you a mid-to-senior engineer?Have you previously interviewed at Amazon?Have you previously worked at a FAANG?If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you will likely not have to do an online assessment, and your first step will be a recruiter call. That said, we’ve gotten some conflicting reports from Amazonians, and it may be that Amazon has more recently started using online assessments to test the competencies of more senior engineers as well.If you do the online assessment, here’s how it works. It’s a timed, asynchronous test consisting of several coding problems, conducted via HackerRank. These are usually data structures and algorithm problems of easy to medium-level difficulty, as well as some multiple choice system design questions where you have to select the design option that’s ideal in a given situation. If you do well in the online assessment, you can skip the second step, which is the technical phone screen. If you end up skipping the online assessment, the first step in your process will be a recruiter call. Please see the section above called “A note about recruiter calls.”Step 2: Technical phone screen Amazon’s technical phone interview is a coding interview that tends to focus exclusively on data structures and algorithms. Despite the focus on speed, Amazon interview questions may require a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.For these screens, Amazon uses an internal tool called Livecode, which has syntax highlighting for popular languages but does NOT have the ability to run the code. In fact, no code is ever compiled or run in Amazon technical interviews.Finally, there’s a 50% chance that your interviewer will throw in 1 or 2 Leadership Principles questions into the phone screen. They’re not guaranteed, but they’ll definitely come up during the onsite.Step 3: Onsite interviewsThere’s some variance, but the typical Amazon onsite, or in-person interview, for technical roles, will consist of:At least one behavioral round (this doesn’t include all the Leadership Principles questions peppered through the other interviews)Three coding rounds One system design round One hiring manager roundAmazon has a special type of interviewer that they include in onsite loops: the Bar Raiser. These are typically senior-level Amazon employees at the top of the formal interviewer hierarchy, and they’re the toughest and most-trained interviewers at Amazon. They serve as an independent and objective evaluator, asking follow-up questions, and ensuring that hiring decisions are not influenced solely by the candidate's immediate team or department. Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon“Being a Bar Raiser makes an impact on your promotion packet. Every L5 nearing promotion at Amazon, is encouraged to do the Bar Raiser training. It’s a big input to get to L6 or L7. Part of the promotion packet is: how are you demonstrating some of the Leadership Principles. And “Hire and Develop the Best” is one of the LPs. There’s a lot of work to do in hiring to become a Bar Raiser: you have to do a lot of training and a ton of interviews. Being a Bar Raiser carries a lot of weight at Amazon if you want to get promoted.”At Amazon, Bar Raisers and hiring managers are the only interviewers who have the formal authority to veto a hiring decision. You can recognize them because they are the only interviewer in your onsite loop who has nothing to do with the team you’re interviewing for. Bar Raiser rounds can be super intense, but don’t shrink when you feel a Bar Raiser throw flames your way; embrace the fire.The three types of Amazon interviewThere are three main types of interviews you’ll face as a software engineer interviewing at Amazon. These are coding, behavioral, and system design interviews.1. Coding interviewYou will have to do coding interviews in the phone screen and in the onsite. Coding rounds at the onsite are very similar to technical phone screen rounds, except that in the technical phone screen you might get Leadership Principles questions, whereas in the onsite coding portion, you definitely will.Amazon asks mostly medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions and avoids hard questions. The idea is to let candidates demonstrate how quickly they get to the optimal result, all in the service of hiring engineers who can churn out new features quickly. Despite the focus on speed, Amazon questions may be a complex problem that requires a lot of code, and the time allowed is usually 30-40 minutes, which means you’ll usually get one question, as opposed to Facebook, where you might get multiple questions.Amazon’s coding rounds test the following technical skills:Computer science fundamentals and knowledge of data structures and algorithmsThe ability to write logical and maintainable code. These rounds require writing some classes and implementing some functions, e.g., “Implement some common functions of a file system”Although your performance in technical interviews matters (if you fail the technical, you usually will not move forward), it’s not as important as the outcome of the behavioral interview, and coding interviews during the onsite at Amazon actually feature Leadership Principles questions. Anecdote from a Amazon Interviewer“Because no code is ever run on an editor, the approach, speed, and testing are most important. Code syntax, typos, variable naming, and edge cases are less important.”Graph questions are among the most popular types of questions asked at Amazon, as well as tree questions that require BFS or DFS. Classic questions like LRU cache, meeting rooms, word break, word search, word ladder, and so on may also come up. We’ve heard from Amazon interviewers that all of the data structures and algorithms questions in Amazon’s official question bank are actually on LeetCode. That said, Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in coding rounds, and some will deviate from the question bank to ask more practical questions such as, “Implement a function with some behavior with the help of these two APIs…””Finally, like Facebook, Amazon shies away from dynamic programming questions (though they’re not banned outright).For everything you need to prepare for Amazon’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Amazon coding interview preparation resources\" below.2. Behavioral interviewThe behavioral interview is one of, along with coding interviews at the onsite, the most important in terms of leading to an offer.Anecdote from a Bar Raiser at Amazon“I’ve done over a hundred interviews at Amazon. The behavioral interview is most likely to get someone pushed over the line if they were borderline in their technical interviews. The opposite is not true: if they don’t meet the behavioral bar, we don’t care how they did in technicals, we aren’t hiring them.”Behavioral is an extremely important part of the Amazon interview process – Amazon is more likely to downlevel or reject you solely based on behavioral – and their behavioral round might be the most well-thought-out interview in all of big tech. It also might be the easiest to fail if you don’t specifically prepare for it. There’s no flavor like the flavor of an Amazonian behavioral interviewer; if you’ve never encountered it before and don’t expect it, it can be jarring. One of the most common mistakes our users make is not taking this interview seriously because at most other companies, behavioral interviews tend to be more lip service than a meaningful part of the process. The bottom line is, if you want an Amazon job at a senior level or above, you have to seriously prepare for the behavioral interview questions.Tip to get unstuckNot all Leadership Principles are created equal. Customer Obsession is the 👑one Leadership Principle to rule them all. When in doubt, demonstrate Customer Obsession. If you get a curveball, give an answer that shows you’re deeply committed to making things customers love. Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser“If you have a bad LP round, or if LPs are problematic in the debrief, it’s almost always a ‘no hire.’ But if you have great LPs then there is a conversation where we try to see if the candidate can be hired even if the technical rounds weren't at the bar. But not the other way around. But if there’s anything ‘at the bar’ or ‘below the bar’ for LP, then you fail.”Anecdote from Amazon Bar Raiser“If a candidate does not do that well on the technical round but they do well on LPs, there is always a possibility of recycling the candidate because they’re a good fit for Amazon but not good for the team. So sometimes we’ll help them interview with other teams, and they don’t have to do a full onsite: they just need to do 1-2 more rounds as a follow up. But if they’re below the bar for LPs, then they’re not a fit for Amazon so Amazon wouldn’t help set them up to other teams with shortened onsites.”In this round, expect questions from all 5 of these categories:Technical problem solvingLearning (and failure)Getting stuff (for the business) doneInterpersonal conflictAmbiguityHonestly, the best place to find a detailed question list for Amazon’s behavioral interview, as well as a bunch of other interview preparation resources, is our Senior Engineer's Guide to the Amazon Leadership Principles Interview.3. System design interviewSystem design and coding aren’t the be-all and end-all at Amazon – of course, you still have to pass them, but if your performance is borderline, doing well on behavioral Leadership Principles questions will take you over the finish line. In fact, interviewers will likely ask you 1-2 Leadership Principles questions in your system design interviews. Try to be efficient when answering LP questions in system design rounds. LPs come first. Finish them early so that you have more time for the technical question.Anecdote from an Amazon Interviewer“In many debriefs, I hear the hiring manager say that we can extend the L5 offer with the understanding that system design is not their strength, but it's coachable. At the L6 level, the system design bar is comparable to Facebook or Google.”Tip to get unstuckIf you’re in a system design round at Amazon, and you don’t know what to talk about, talk about performance. They want Amazon to be the number one customer of AWS. And they love to find engineers who understand and are passionate about fine tuning performance in the cloud. Amazon is more likely to ask you practical system design questions. For example, if you’re interviewing with a team who controls Amazon’s inventory management, they might ask you to design a piece of an inventory management system. Other common system design questions include:Design autocompleteDesign file upload/download to the cloudDesign searchThe design questions are most likely about designing well-known features, as opposed to a complete system from scratch like Design Facebook or Twitter. Amazon interviewers are allowed to ask whatever they want in system design, but a lot of interviewers fall back on reusing questions from Amazon’s question bank. For tooling in system design interviews, candidates can usually choose any type of drawing tool. Excalidraw is most popular, followed by Miro.How Amazon makes hiring decisionsAmazon has one of the more well-structured decision-making processes in tech: teams typically do a pre-brief (live meeting before the onsite), submit asynchronous feedback, and also do a debrief (live meeting after the onsite). They rely heavily on live discussion to make decisions. Notably, though some interviewers might be able to tell an outlier story of a time a regular interviewer out-argued a Bar Raiser, most of the time the interviewers go along with what the Bar Raiser says. Amazon interviewer’s grade on a 5-point scale: Strongly Inclined, Inclined, Neutral, Not Inclined, Strongly Not Inclined.The two most important interviewers at the onsite are the Bar Raiser and the hiring manager. At Amazon, all of the other team members involved in the interview could vote to hire, but if the Bar Raiser or the hiring manager aren’t on board, that candidate is likely getting rejected.Tip to get unstuckAt Amazon, identify the Bar Raiser (the only person whose work has nothing to do with the team for which you’re interviewing) and the hiring manager (if you don’t know who it is, ask the recruiter before the onsite or an interviewer if during the onsite). Most of your energy should go towards impressing these two people – since Amazon relies so heavily on live discussions to make hiring decisions, impression management is more impactful here.

Do anonymous mock interviews with real Google interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.See available timesBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Google’s job interview process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers. All human organizations behave like a metaphor; Google isn’t a sports team, or a family, or an army. It’s a cool grad school. Larry and Sergey set up their offices based on the model of a Stanford campus on purpose. They wanted to create an environment and company culture where people can feel chill enough to talk about anything. In general, Google interviewers tend to be more collaborative than other FAANG interviewers. At Google, the slower you go, the faster you get there. Google has one big, centralized interview process that’s completely divorced from which team you might end up on, which means that you will NOT, however, be interviewing with your future team members – Google has a horde of interchangeable technical interviewers who have all been trained on the same process. If you do well, there will be a team matching component at the end.At Google, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently, which means you don’t get multiple shots on goal. Not only that, but Google has a limit for how many chances they’ll give you before you’re blocked from interviewing again. Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“You can interview three times in 5 years. If you fail all three times then you can’t interview at Google again: you’re blocked.”Note that recently, there have been rumblings of Google changing their process to something more decentralized, where a hiring manager chooses you for a team before you interview, nullifying the need for post-onsite team matching. As far as we know, this new model is being tried out right now, but the change hasn’t been adopted company-wide.Google also has rules for candidates who pass their interviews:Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“If you pass Google’s onsite, and end up not taking the offer, your “passing of the onsite '' is good for about a year. And if you choose to re-engage in that time, the process varies widely. Usually you can skip the phone interview. Most times you have to do the full or partial onsite. If you choose to re-engage, tell their recruiters ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get as many steps skipped as you can.”Google is not results-oriented. They’re process oriented. In other words, they care more about the “How” than the “What”. You’ve heard it before, and it’s true – they don’t need you to get to the optimal solution, but they do need to be impressed by your thought process. Because of this, Google is more attracted to comfort with ambiguity than speed.Oddly, in spite of using a centralized interview process, Google doesn’t have in-depth training for its interviewers; it may surprise some candidates that there’s a larger-than-expected number of bad interviewers at Google. Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“There is one thing that always bothered me about the Google interview process. And it's something that a lot of candidates don’t realize. There are a lot of bad interviewers at Google. Mostly because there are a lot of highly talented people who think they know everything. I was the interviewer for the third interview round at in-person onsite. And I saw the candidate was there by himself; the second interviewer wasn’t there. The candidate was alone because the second interviewer got frustrated – they thought the candidate wasn’t worth the time for an onsite, so they left early.”Anecdote from an Interviewer Who Worked at Google and Facebook“Google is more likely than Facebook to design questions on purpose to be tricky. At Google, sometimes this is intentionally disguising technical questions to look like X but they’re really Y. And other times at Google, it’s designing a technical question such that if a candidate doesn’t ask a particular question they likely won’t get the answer.” Step 1: Recruiter callPlease see the section above called “A note about recruiter calls” Step 2: Technical phone screenGoogle’s technical phone screen is a coding interview that focuses exclusively on data structures and algorithms questions. Your interviewer will ask you to write code to solve a specific problem.One idiosyncratic aspect of Google’s process is their insistence on using Google docs for writing code (versus other companies which tend to use tools like CoderPad). This can be a bit jarring for those of us who are used to writing code in an IDE that does things like auto-indentation, auto-complete, syntax highlighting, adding missing parentheses or brackets etc. Despite not using an IDE, your interviewer will expect you to produce syntactically correct code. This is really hard. Tip to get unstuckBefore your Google interview, you should practice in Google docs so you don’t forget to close parentheses or indent your code.That said, more recently, Google has started interviewing using an internal tool with syntax highlighting, indentation and brackets completion. Whether you get to use it or not depends on your geography.Step 2.5: (In some cases) Another technical phone screenThe second phone screen happens only if the first one did not produce enough signal to move forward. Perhaps you didn’t communicate your thought process well enough, your code wasn’t of good enough quality, or you weren’t fast enough – but it’ll be only one of these – if you struggled with two or all three, most likely you aren’t moving forward. Tip to get unstuckIf you do get scheduled for a second phone screen, push your recruiter to give you detailed feedback so you can do better the second time – nothing beats knowing exactly where you need to improve. You probably won’t get a response, but if you do it’s a large boost to your prep.If you get a second phone screen it will be very similar to the first in terms of structure and content.Step 3: OnsiteThe Google onsite usually includes 4-6 rounds. Recently, there have been some internal experiments with the format, but generally the rounds are primarily coding, and secondarily system design. Some candidates get a single behavioral round, and others get to skip it. The more experience you have, the higher proportion of system design and domain-specific questions you can expect to be asked.Google’s interview types in detailAs we mentioned above, Google is process-oriented rather than results-oriented. As such, communication during coding and system design rounds is more important at Google than the end result.Coding The most important rounds at Google are coding. In fact, Google is the only FAANG company that considers coding to be more important than system design. Google’s coding rounds are about complexity more than speed. Their interviewers are allowed to ask anything they want, so it's more likely you might get a question you’ve never practiced before. Google interviewers are more likely than any other FAANG company to purposefully design a question so it tricks candidates. For example, they’ll disguise a question to look like it’s Three Sum, but that’s a red herring – it’s not a Three Sum problem. It just looks like one. A lot of what you’ll see in the onsite coding mirrors what you saw in the technical phone screen. During the onsite, you may see your interviewer layer more complexity on top of questions – they’ll design a question where they plan for you to get to the solution, then when you do they’ll move the goalposts and say something like: “Remember that assumption we made earlier about \\[X thing\\]? Let’s remove that. How would that change your approach?”Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“At Google, I’ve passed more people that arrive at the optimal solution without coding it than I do people who arrive at the optimal solution and code it. The actual code you write is less important than the thought process.”Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“Google is highly unstructured. Everyone can ask whatever they want.”Even though they can ask whatever they want, Google interviewers have a question bank too, but the bank is much much bigger than Facebook’s bank and, like Facebook’s bank, it’s community maintained. Some interviewers never deviate from the bank, and others don’t touch it, preferring instead to formulate their own unique questions.. This speaks to Google rewarding the “how” (aka “how a candidate got there”) or their thought processes. It also speaks to Google rewarding comfort with ambiguity. Other FAANGs have specific niche topics they love hearing and talking about (such as “performance” at Amazon), but Google is more abstract. Google might love speaking about and asking about ambiguity more than any other FAANG.Finally, Google’s coding questions are never practical. They are always theoretical. They will never ask you to pull up your own environment and write a program. They will also never ask you to take a solution to a coding problem and apply it to a real world scenario. When prepping for Google, only practice theoretical questions. For everything you need to prepare for Google’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Google coding interview preparation resources\" below.System design The second most important onsite interview type at Google is system design. Again, they are allowed to ask anything they want, so don’t be scared off if you get a question you’ve never practiced before. High-level and low-level system design questions are both likely. Some examples include: Design a load balancer Design Facebook Messenger Design an auth platformGoogle system design interviewers also tend to design problems that include linchpin questions. These are questions where if you don’t ask about a specific aspect of the problem, you can’t really solve it. For example, an older system design question at Google asked you to set up a service in some foreign country, and in the prompt, the interviewer mentioned that you have a dependency on some third party service. The linchpin question to ask: “What’s the service level agreement for that 3rd party service?” If you didn’t ask that (or something like it), then you wouldn’t be able to effectively reason about availability, which you’d need to do in order to do well on the question. Tip to get unstuckTo avoid getting tricked, ask even more questions in Google system design rounds than you normally would.Behavioral The least important round at Google is the behavioral round. They have the easiest behavioral screen in FAANG. Plus, you might complete an onsite at Google without a behavioral round because they’re optional. It’s not clear which candidates get them and which don’t. This is another reason to not prep too hard for their behavioral round. If you do get some behavioral questions, they might be one of the following:Tell me about a time when you had a colleague who was difficult to work with.Tell me about a time you received negative feedback.Tell me about a time you were mentoring a more junior engineer and your feedback wasn’t getting through to them. If you were going to plan an offsite for the team, how would you do it?Google is also more likely to ask you reflective questions. Most other FAANGs stick to situational questions such as, “Tell me of a time when…”. Those situational questions ask you to describe a past circumstance or scenario you’ve actually experienced and are fairly straightforward to answer. Reflective questions, on the other hand, can be tricky because they’re asking you to reflect on, or speak to, something less concrete, e.g., “What do you think about setting goals?” The smart way to answer a reflective question is to re-formulate it, and then answer as if it’s a situational question. So, “What do you think about setting goals” instead becomes,”Talk about a time you used goal-setting as a time management strategy”, which you can now more-easily answer by describing a real experience and outcome, “The last time I set goals…etc”, as opposed to wading into theories about personal agency. “I think goals are cool and important…” might not get high marks.Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“To be honest, there was some cultural backlash at Google when they announced that we had to do these behavioral interviews. What that means is you may get an interviewer who has very little interest in conducting this type of interview. Which could go very good or very bad. I have some peers who think this should not be a part of the interview process. So they give everyone the highest marks, pretty much just to eliminate this category from the interview. Google is primarily engineers, and most of the engineers think that this is a bunch of HR BS. So they either just won’t accept any calendar invites they get or they'll just check the boxes.”How Google makes hiring decisionsMost of the time, the post-interview feedback process at Google is completely asynchronous, and interviewers don’t meet live to discuss hiring decisions. That’s one reason why interviewing at Google isn’t like interviewing with humans: it’s more akin to interviewing with a machine.Each interviewer rates candidates on the following seven-point scale: Strong No-Hire, No Hire, Leaning No-Hire, On The Fence, Leaning Hire, Hire, and Strong Hire.How this affects candidates is simple: a Strong Hire can get you an offer, but it can also buy you a second chance. If you don’t get an offer, but you get a Strong Hire from one of your interviewers, you might be offered one bonus interview round to decide whether you get an offer or not.That said, you don’t need to get a “Strong Hire” to get a second chance. Overall, if you showed enough signal to not-fail but not enough to pass, sometimes they will ask you to do an additional round. Tip to get unstuckIf you get lucky enough to get a round where you are really excelling, don’t quit while you’re ahead. Keep going. In that round, don’t just strive to win; strive for total domination.A “Strong No-Hire” bars you from interviewing at Google for some time. Reports vary here, but one of our Google interviewers told us that if you get a Strong No-Hire, you might be frozen out for several years. If you passed overall then you will move on to the hiring committee phase.Hiring committee review & team matchingGoogle’s hiring committee consists of four to five engineers and engineering managers who have not interviewed you, with the intent of making hiring decisions as objective as possible.Going into the hiring committee review, your recruiter will prepare a packet that consists of your resume, any notes from the person who referred you (if you were referred), your recruiter’s notes from their call with you, and all the feedback from your interviewers, from the technical phone screen to the onsite.Resume screening tipIf you’re told you’ve passed the onsite, ask if you can submit a more recent copy of your resume. Some Google recruiters will let your new resume be the only resume the Hiring Committee sees. Your resume you submitted for the online application probably wasn’t customized for Google, but what you submit to the hiring committee can be. When the committee meets, they evaluate all the data on you holistically, and they need a consensus in order to decide to make a hire.Other than hire/no-hire decisions, the hiring committee will also decide on leveling. Ever since COVID and the rise of remote interviewing, we’ve gotten more and more reports from users that they’re being down-leveled at Google. Apparently the rationale is that Google doesn’t feel like they get as much signal from remote interviews as they did from in-person ones, and as such, when they don’t get enough of a signal for a hire but too much good signal for a rejection: they downlevel – when you want to reduce the probability of a false positives for L5… offer L4! Engineers who are downleveled at Google accept the lower level offer a lot of the time, especially in the current climate. In some extreme cases, we’ve seen engineering managers with 10+ YoE accept an L3 (basically a new grad) offer.Once you get past the hiring committee, you will move on to team matching. The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. In the ideal case, your recruiter will propose a few teams that are actively looking for someone with your skills, and then you’ll meet with the hiring manager from each team to gauge cultural fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.That said, there are rare instances where a candidate will get past the hiring committee but then not find a team that they gel with. Anecdote from a Google Interviewer“Getting five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’ is most likely to result in a ‘No Hire’ decision. I have seen many cases where the candidates got five scores of ‘Leaning Hire’, and the recruiter gave them positive feedback too, but the candidate got rejected. In these cases, every person the candidate dealt with directly (the interviewers) were positive, yet the hiring committee (the only people in the process who dealt with the candidate indirectly) rejected the candidate.”Google coding interview preparation resourcesHere are some tips for preparing for your Google coding interview:Practice in teams; have someone make up a question. Then have them disguise it or plant a red herring in it (for example, purposefully have it look like Three Sum, but it isn’t Three Sum).Practice with someone who can change the parameters after you’ve solved the main question by saying things like “Remember that assumption X we made earlier. What would happen if we removed that assumption?”If you see a question online that has been marked as “Asked in a Google interview”, then it is not going to be asked in your interview, period. Google is very good at retiring questions that have been leaked.Practice without the aid of an editor or IDE: in a Google doc, on a whiteboard, or with pen and paper.In addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Google content for you!

They’ve gotten very aggressive, and if you don’t know the rules, you will fail.Meta’s interview process and questionsMeta’s interview process consists of the following steps:Call with a Meta recruiterTechnical phone screen (and possibly a second technical phone screen)Onsite interviewsWant to know if you’re ready to interview at Meta? Do anonymous mock interviews with real Meta interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.See available timesBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Meta’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers. Meta interviewers are guided by the company’s current motto: move fast. All human groups have a metaphor they operate from. Meta isn’t a family or an army. They’re a well-structured Formula 1 team; they spend a lot of effort to put safeguards in place, and then they go pedal to the metal. At Meta, speed wins.At Meta, because the process is centralized, you cannot interview with multiple teams concurrently like you can at some other tech companies. You get one shot on goal every ~3 to 6 months, depending on performance.Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“If you pass Meta’s onsite, but don’t take the offer your status of ‘passed onsite’ is valid for a year. If you don’t take their offer and then choose to re-engage within that year, tell their recruiter ‘I already passed the onsite’ and push to get steps skipped because you usually can.”Tip to get unstuckWhen interviewing at Meta, listen closely to the subtle clues and hints your interviewer gives you. Meta is the only FAANG where you can’t become an interviewer unless you give good hints.Step 1: Recruiter callPlease see the previous section called “A note about recruiter calls”. Also read our guide to negotiating with Meta. It starts at the recruiter call.Step 2: Technical phone screenMeta's technical phone screen is a 45-minute coding interview that focuses on data structures and algorithms.At the beginning of the interview, your interviewer will ask you a question or two about your resume and recent work that you've done. This portion will take 5 minutes, and how you answer these questions doesn't meaningfully factor into the interview's outcome - they are just meant to break the ice and get you talking. The part that matters is the technical portion.After the intro portion, your interviewer will ask you two coding questions, and they expect you to get through both in 35 minutes. These questions will be LeetCode easy or medium difficulty.Meta’s technical phone screens are conducted in CoderPad. If you've never used it, you may want to play around in their sandbox and get familiar with their environment before your real interview. One specific thing about Meta's way of using CoderPad is that during the interview, they'll have code execution turned off - if you've used it before and are accustomed to testing your code during the interview by running it, you'll need to practice not being able to.Step 3: Onsite interviewsThe typical Meta onsite will consist of the following:At least two coding interviewsTwo system design OR product design interviewsOne behavioral interviewAlternate Process for E6 engineersThe process for E6 engineers, as outlined in the diagram above, is slightly different. There will be a Leadership Assessment interview after the Technical Screen. In this interview, the following topics might be covered:Your current role, responsibility, and scopeCross-functional partnershipsSituations regarding conflict resolutionSolution skillsHow to drive resultsThe onsite for E6 engineers will also be different. You should only get one coding round, one architecture round, one design round and then a behavioral round.Types of Meta interviews and what to expectThere are four main types of interviews you’re going to encounter when you apply for an engineering job at Meta – coding interviews, behavioral interviews, and either a system design or product design interview. Here’s what to expect during each of these rounds of interviews.Coding interviewMeta's process is highly standardized, so coding interview questions and themes tend to repeat. Coding questions are pre-approved, but that doesn’t mean the interviewers have no freedom.Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“Meta gives you the questions to ask or modify. But they don't tell you the answers in their interviewing wiki. And they let you design the path of the question: you get to ask your own twists and turns.”Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“There’s some variance with the interviewer, but usually there are 20 mins per question, and the questions are simple. They want you to get the algorithm fast, and implement the basic solution. The kind of bugs that can be acceptable are empty input, and out of scope inputs like empty array/null. But an incomplete algorithm at Meta usually doesn’t cut it. They want you to get to it and get to it quickly, and you can sacrifice making a little bit of a mess along the way.” Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“I think there is a rule that during the programming interview, interviewers have to ask two questions. And the questions have to be balanced. The first is more like a juicy question testing problem solving skills and you as the interviewer can permit some bugs in the implementation. The second will be easy from the algorithmic point of view but the goal is to assess how much the candidate can write debugless code and test this code perfectly. And if a candidate fails to solve both problems, even if they somewhat shine during one problem: it will be ‘No Hire’.”It's not that bugs are encouraged, it’s that they're the only company that's top-down directive is: sometimes, in certain rounds, bugs are okay. No other company does that. Meta relaxes the need for bug-free code so that candidates can code faster. Finally, Meta doesn’t ask dynamic programming questions and, in fact, those questions are banned.For everything you need to prepare for Meta’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Meta coding interview preparation resources\" below.System design OR product design interviewMeta hires two types (on paper) of backend engineers: System Generalists and Product Generalists. System generalists get a system design interview, and product generalists get the confusingly named product design interview (in most other contexts, product design refers to UI/UX).Which of these interviews you get is determined by your recruiter, based on your experience. If you have worked on a lot of product features, then you get a product design interview. If you have worked on high-scale distributed systems, then you get system design.The product design interview at Meta is similar to the system design interview but with some key differences:System design focuses more on high level architecture and scale, while product design focuses more on interactions between services. For example, the expectations for API design in system design interviews is just high level arguments/data passed, whereas product design focuses more on the details, i.e., a more comprehensive list of arguments and response structure.Product design focuses more on how and what data flows through the entire system, between each service.Data models are weighted much higher in the product design interview than in system design. The expectation is to be more thorough and detailed.Take a look at this video, by Meta, about the difference between these two interview types:Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“Product design is less databases, more data flow, more time spent on details of the API (e.g. parameters that will pass). System design is more databases, less API details, and more about scaling.”Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“Many people think Meta only asks high level system design questions like ‘Design Twitter’ or ‘Design Meta Feed.’ But that’s not the case. They also ask low level questions. In E6 or above interviews, you will most likely be asked ‘Design Redis’, or ‘Design Kafka’, or ‘Design Memcached.’ I’d even seen rare occasions where E5 candidates would be asked low-level system design questions; low-level questions are less common in rounds for E5 and below.”Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“You have to ask about back of the envelope estimations. A lot of senior engineers hate to do that. I hate to do that as well. It’s a waste of time. When I do the ‘There is a rule that I have to do this. But there is no point in doing this. Let’s spend 5 minutes talking about real system design. Let’s assume we have to scale our system from 0 to Google level and therefore estimations are just a waste of time.’”Tip to get unstuckAsk your interviewer: “Do you want to spend a few minutes on estimations? I’m okay with skipping it, but if you need to see it, then let’s do it. If we skipped it, one thing that might be a more interesting conversation would be spending a few minutes on how to scale this system.’”Tip to get unstuckIf you don’t know what to talk about in a E5 Meta system design round, talk about user experience. Go on about two choices you could make, then explain in depth the one preferred because it’d be a better user experience. It’s also common for Meta interviewers to ask you to walk them through a system you’ve worked on in the past, which is known as a reverse system design interview. Behavioral interviewUnlike technical questions, behavioral questions at Meta are not standardized: interviewers can ask you whatever they want. Behavioral rounds are of medium/low importance at Meta; they’re less important than technical interview rounds, but they do carry some weight. For the best summary of what to expect in a Meta behavioral interview, read this blog post by a former Meta engineering manager – in it he describes exactly how behavioral interviews at Meta are evaluated and also includes a bunch of sample questions.Here is a list of questions to get you started. Read the post to get examples of good answers (split out by the candidate’s seniority level!)“What project are you most proud of and why?”“Tell me about a recent day working that was really great and/or fun.”“Tell me about a time when you wanted to change something that was outside of your regular scope of work.”“Tell me about a time you had to make a fast decision and live with the results.”“Tell me about a time when you needed to overcome external obstacles to complete a task or project.”“Tell me about a time a project took longer as expected.”“Tell me about a person or team who you found most challenging to work with.”“Tell me about a time you disagreed with a coworker.”“Tell me about a situation where two teams couldn’t agree on a path forward.”“Describe a situation when you made a mistake, and what you learned from it.”“Tell me about some constructive feedback you received from a manager or a peer”“Tell me about a skill set that you observed in a peer or mentor that you want to develop in the next six months.”Finally, if you are applying for E5 and above make sure to have a couple of projects that lasted longer than one quarter – if all your examples are of smaller initiatives, your interviewer may walk away with the impression that you can’t handle complex projects. Also, remember to quantify the impact that you made by sharing specific metrics.How Meta makes hiring decisionsMeta’s candidate review and feedback process is usually completely asynchronous. Sometimes, they’ll do a live debrief but it’s rare. This means there’s a low likelihood for an interviewer to “fight” for a candidate. Socially influencing interviewers won’t go very far here. Meta is also the only FAANG that asks interviewers for a confidence score when filling out post-onsite feedback forms. As a result, the process at Meta can be more forgiving on failed rounds because a lower confidence score means a failed round carries less weight. Also, Meta is the only FAANG that directly asks interviewers about downleveling. Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“Coding is used to decide ‘Should we hire this person?’ System and product design is used to decide ‘How should we level this person?’For coding interviews, the interviewer says a binary score first: ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’. Then in the comments, they say how confident they are in that binary score. The ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ is an official metric, but the confidence score is not. For system/product design, the interviewer gives the ‘Hire’ or ‘No Hire’ first. Then they say if the candidate should be considered for another level. So the final decision could be like: ‘No Hire’ for E5 with low confidence. ‘Hire’ for E4 with high confidence.\"In cases where the hiring panel is hung, it’s possible they may request one more follow-up interview to help them get more signal.Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“Interview feedback is discussed primarily by the system design and behavioral interviewers, and those are the interviewers who have the most say regarding both the hire decision and a candidate’s level. If interviewers don’t feel like they got enough signal and the candidate ends up being on the fence, the recruiter will push for an additional round. Indicative hint: If you have an additional follow-up interview, your interviewers were probably split.\"Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“At Staff level and above, it’s a mandate that candidates can’t get hired if they don’t pass both system design rounds.”Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“For E6 and above candidates, if you fail one system design round but do well in the other rounds, you can get a mulligan. They can let you retake one system design round. But the same isn’t true for behavioral: if you fail there’s no mulligan. If you fail the behavioral round, it will be ‘No Hire.’”'Team matching, offers, and “Bootcamp”'Meta made some changes to their process in 2023. Before, unlike at other FAANGs, you'd generally accept an offer before knowing with which team you'd end up on. Then you'd do a 6 week “Bootcamp”, where you'd be trained on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems. After the bootcamp, there would be a 2 week team-matching period.Now, after you finish the onsite, you jump straight to the team matching process. Team matching now happens BEFORE you get an offer, and offers are contingent on team matching completely successfully.You'll talk with hiring managers from a number of teams to gauge fit and chemistry: we've heard that sometimes it's a handful, and sometimes it's over 10.After your team matching conversations, your recruiter will ask you to choose a team. In order to move forward, both you and the hiring manager have to opt in.Once you make your choice, your recruiter will officially make an offer, and you'll usually have just a few days to make your decision. We hope this will change in the future, but recently Meta has been very aggressive with both offer timelines and with negotiations - they will not negotiate unless you can share competitive offer details from another top-tier company.One other key difference between Meta's new process and the old one is what happens during Bootcamp. Historically, Bootcamp took 6 weeks, and in addition to training new hires on Meta's engineering infrastructure and systems, there'd be a multi-week “speed dating”-esque team matching component.Bootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter - 2-4 weeks, and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers will continue to ramp up on their specific teams.The team matching process is a bit like speed dating. You meet with hiring managers to gauge fit and chemistry. In order to move forward, both of you have to opt in.Anecdote from a Meta Interviewer“When the market is good, you can talk to 20 different teams at the same time.”There are exceptions – some people with niche skills may get hired for a specific team before they start Bootcamp, but they still have to do the bootcamp period, just not the team-matching part afterwards.Meta coding interview preparation resourcesWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Meta content for you!

Do anonymous mock interviews with real Apple interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.See available timesBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Apple’s hiring process, evaluation criteria, and interview experience.Humans in groups act out a chosen metaphor; Apple isn’t a sports team. They’re an army. Their army is made up of people obsessed with making great products. And they look to hire people who’ve embedded Apple products into their lives. Armies reward loyalty more than sports teams. Apple also has the longest tenured employees in FAANG (we're including Microsoft with FAANG for the purposes of this guide). Apple is decentralized and lets candidates interview with different teams concurrently; if you want to maximize your odds interview with as many teams as you have the appetite for. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“I interviewed with like 12 teams. I got 2 offers. Along the way, I told one of the Apple recruiter’s I was interviewing for another Apple team and they shrugged it off; they didn’t care.”Apple’s interview process is more like what you might see at a startup than any other FAANG – from assigning which questions to ask to interviewer training to how hiring decisions get made. Significant inter-team variance is the norm, with each team essentially acting like a startup that’s coming up with its own way of conducting interviews.Anecdote from an Apple InterviewerAt Apple, there’s no formal interviewer training. It’s very ad hoc. Every team is different. There is literally no process. What each of the teams does is rely on one of their very senior engineers or someone very experienced. Apple has a lot of people with long tenures, like 15 years. One of my colleagues had been there for 22 years. At Apple, the more senior you get the more the team trusts you to come up with your own questions. So what the interviewers at Apple typically do: you come up with a question that's not online, and you make sure it’s relevant to what your team is doing. Then you pitch it to your manager or tech lead. Then you run with it. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“One thing not enough candidates know about is this: there’s no such thing as an Apple interview. You apply for a team. Not the company. When people ask me “How to prepare for an Apple interview?” I say ask the recruiter. Because they usually know what types of questions are asked. The recruiter spends 30 minutes or an hour per debrief where engineers are talking about the details about the code. So if the recruiter is paying attention or is at least a little bit technical, they should have a clue whether it’s LeetCode-style questions or embedded style questions. So ask your Apple recruiter a forced-choice question like, ‘Is this interview more X or more Y?’”Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“I was one of the people to come up with a take-home assignment for candidates. Which was my favorite part of the process at Apple. We were hiring people for full-stack but not just any full-stack – we wanted people who were coding in Python on the back-end and a particular framework on the front-end. We cooked up a take-home which was a scaled down version of what they’d be doing on the job: an internal tool built in those exact technologies. We gave them that take home and had them work on it for a week. Then we discussed it at the onsite where we’d live-debug it and talk about architecture. I really liked this ‘Try before you buy’ style process. Because Apple really wants you to be productive in week 2, if not at the end of week 1.”Apple is the most likely to shock you; they’re more likely to ask you something you didn’t prepare for. Out of all the FAANGs, they’re the ones you can expect to do something unexpected, and some of their tactics can seem mercenary. Apple is the only FAANG which sometimes has a process to cut interviews short if the candidate clearly isn’t meeting the bar – if you don't perform above the bar for the first half of the interview, they’ll cancel the rest. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“If by the fourth round, the hiring manager has gotten consistent feedback that doesn’t meet the bar, then they’d end the onsite early and reject the candidate.”Apple is not results or process oriented. They’re motivation oriented. In other words, they care more about the “Why” than the “What” or the “How”, and as such, they value behavioral interviews more than coding.Apple employees are obsessed with privacy. It’s not just marketing lip service. When asked if “privacy” is a buzzword at Apple, our interviewers said…Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“Privacy isn't just a buzzword. We are obsessed with it. To drive that part home. Because it’s so important. And as I mentioned, I was a part of a group focused on gathering user data - users here being Apple internal employees – to inform future products. Even at Apple, when we’re just getting data from internal employees, we anonymized the data. Just to practice what we preach. Privacy is huge. Another example to illustrate that is that people get fired for torrenting music.”Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“Unless you’re interviewing for a security role, very rarely. Technical people at Apple are hired to do what they do best. They have a whole army of compliance folks and lawyers to take care of that stuff. They also have an internal police force called “InfoSec”, which is the team which takes care of the secrecy stuff. Engineers are needed to do what they were hired to do: engineering.”Step 1: Recruiter call Please see the section above called “A note about recruiter calls” for what to expect. We do encourage you to ask your recruiter what to expect for the rest of the process because as you’ll see, there is a lot of variance from team to team.Tip to get unstuck“Ask your Apple recruiter forced choice questions with two options, such as, ‘Is this coding round more of a typical LeetCode round, or more of a domain-specific open ended deep dive into a specific technology?’”Step 2: Technical phone interviewLike everything else at Apple, the format and technical questions presented in Apple phone screens can vary a ton. Verify this by asking your recruiter! Technical phone screens are coding interviews that range from 30 minutes to an hour. This tech interview may be between you and a single interviewer or sometimes a panel of interviewers. It may even be a hiring manager screen with a mix of behavioral questions and coding.In any case, the general format is a shared coding environment where the interviewer(s) can assess your ability to utilize basic data structures and algorithms concepts. Being able to provide a solution for coding questions and quickly analyze the runtime complexity of your solution are key skills to have going into this interview.The tooling used in Apple’s technical interview rounds depends on the team you’re interviewing with, but we’ve heard that some teams use CoderPad.(In some cases) Step 2.5: Take-home assignmentSome teams give candidates a take-home assignment. They can give this around the same time they schedule a phone screen. The hiring manager is usually the person to decide whether or not candidates get one. Step 3: OnsiteThere will be roughly six to eight in-person rounds of interviews, each of which will be with your future teammates. Each round will have least one, or possibly two, interviewers.Note that an onsite loop with one team at Apple will look very different than an onsite loop with another. Apple’s interview types in detailInterviewers can ask whatever behavioral, coding, or system design questions they want; there is no standardization for Apple interview questions. However, before an interview loop takes place, some teams will do a quick, informal assignment of what kinds of questions each interviewer is supposed to ask so that they don’t all end up asking the same things. Moreover, Apple interviewers are untrained, and as soon as a senior engineer is hired they can start conducting interviews. Apple’s unpredictable nature makes it so some of their interview rounds can’t be categorized into behavioral, coding, or system design. Is a philosophical question about products a behavioral question? Not really. But they might ask one in a behavioral round. Are rapid fire infrastructure-focused open-ended trivia questions more system design or coding? It depends. For example, here’s how one Apple interviewer describes the behind-the-scenes top-down directive before an upcoming onsite. “Go find a question that would be a good one to ask for our team.” That interviewer then ran it up the chain to an engineer above them. Then, that question immediately got asked in the next interview. At Apple, each interview loop is specific to the needs of individual hiring managers – there is no canonical “Apple interview”, and everything is “made to order” for each specific team. That makes it difficult for candidates to prepare.CodingSome teams at Apple prefer practical rounds. Sometimes, they’ll have you write a program on your own laptop and IDE. Other times, they’ll spend the whole round deep diving into a specific technology/use case that’s relevant for their team. For example, a team that wrote in Java and did a lot of work with concurrency had a whole round focused on concurrency in Java!Other teams do medium-ish LeetCode-style questions. At the end of the day, these interviews vary so widely it’s hard to give a specific directive, other than: ask your recruiter. For senior and above candidates, it’s more about demonstrating competence rather than needing to ace the question.For everything you need to prepare for Apple’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Apple coding interview preparation resources\" below.System designApple interviewers tend to ask questions relevant to a specific team’s work. For instance, a team focused on building web services will tend to ask questions about that, while front-end teams may ask UI-related questions. It may be good to try to get a feel for the day-to-day work from the recruiter/hiring manager, as the job descriptions are not always the most helpful (remember: privacy!). Tip to get unstuckIn system design rounds, Apple interviewers love to hear about reliability. If you don’t know what else to talk about, dig into reliability. BehavioralApple’s most important round is usually behavioral or system design. Behavioral rounds are more important than coding rounds. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“In behavioral, you gotta be a rockstar. You gotta be a leader. If you’re abrasive, or if you’re not a cultural fit, how are you going to lead the juniors? And system design is going to weigh a little more than behavioral. If you can’t code or if you’re a little rusty –if you’re good at system design and behavioral–we’ll forgive the subpar coding rounds.”An interesting paradox at Apple is: they highly value behavioral rounds but they don’t have a standardized way to assess candidates in those interviewsAnecdote from an Apple Interviewer“Towards the end of my career at Apple, we had a huge need for mobile developers. People who were able to do iOS apps. I was part of an R&D team. We mainly built web products in the beginning, but towards the end of my career we started doing more mobile stuff. We didn't want to hire someone who could only do mobile. We wanted someone who would be half as good at mobile stuff and half as good at web stuff, so they could plug themselves in anywhere. If the interview process was standardized across the whole company - you can imagine how hard that would be to test specifically for the niche skill set we needed. Within two days we cooked up a whole new homework assignment just for the ios candidates, we cooked up a whole new set of interview questions. We kept the behavioral part the same. But the technical part - we flipped it over just like that. And it was really good. We changed the way we graded, we were able to filter candidates based on the new set of questions. It was just fast. We didn't get any pushback from HR. We didn't have to work with compliance. We just did it. Really fast. Really nimble.”Because Apple doesn’t standardize their interviews, they’re particularly prone to bias. Sometimes the top down guidance to Apple interviewers is something like: “In the behavioral round, just see if you like them. See if you’d like to get a beer with them.”Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“\\[Interviews are never standardized.\\] And i’ll tell you why. Apple is a very secretive company. Everything is on a need to know basis. Also, it's a hugely political place. It was good for me because I understood the game. I didn’t blame the players I played the game. For those who understand the intricacies of politics, and simply accept the fact that it will happen when you have all Type-A people being paid a tremendous amount of money to do shitty little things, it's bound to happen. You have to accept it or you’re not going to play the game. Everything at Apple is very siloed. Even when it comes down to the cost center. Everything is super independent of one another. That's actually one of the strengths and weaknesses of Apple. We double effort for sure. But that doesn't matter to Tim Cook. They have billions of dollars to afford this – not a problem. I also really liked how it was siloed because teams and their priorities change, leadership changes, a lot of things change. Being able to decouple from the greater company enabled them to become one of the biggest, if not the biggest tech company in the world.”Even if rounds aren’t standardized, you will definitely be asked “Why Apple?”, and your answer needs to be on point. Some interviewers reject candidates solely for not having a good answer to this question. “Why Apple?” isn’t always a single question; they can spread this out into multiple questions and drill down on this for a good portion of a behavioral round. You can also expect other motivation-based (or “why”) questions. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“A common red flag is giving generic answers to the ‘Why Apple?’ questions. If I didn't feel their passion or if they’re just treating Apple as another job, that’s usually a red flag for me regardless of their technical competence. They really have to somehow convince me – and this is an emotional response they have to bring out of me – they really have to convince me they really want to work at Apple, they really want to roll up their sleeves, and they really believe in our values: delighting the customer, sweating the details. Making awesome products… We only care about that. We don't care about anything else. That emotional response has to be drawn from me and if they don’t then I’m likely to say, ‘They were good but meh.’”Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“I can tell you about a great answer one candidate had for ‘Why Apple?”. He said something like… His wife and him were university students dating across two continents. This person said they shared a recent feature – I think it was like when you facetime and you can watch video in sync – he shared how that changed his life. His wife and him went through the whole international relationship because of that. That significantly helped their relationship.”Apple wants to hire candidates whose lives have integrated with the Apple products. And the reverse is true too. It's a fatal flaw to say, “I've never used an iPhone or a Macbook or an iPad” because those people clearly haven’t integrated Apple products deeply in their lives. Apple knows what they like, and they like their products! That doesn’t mean all you have to do is gush about the products to pass the behavioral round. It means you have to tell a genuine story which connects you and Apple products or services. Ideally, a story they will remember.Another behavioral factor debated among Apple interviewers is whether or not they agree with the idea that Apple is “cult-ish.”Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“Apple cares most about the ‘Why’. You see that rooted deeply in every apple person's DNA. ‘Why Apple?’ Right? I guess this is where people get this notion of Apple being a ‘cult-ish’ company. Much like Tesla, actually. They have a huge customer following, but you also see the same pattern with their employees. Actually, I totally subscribe to this ideology. Because you want a person you work with day in and day out to have that same passion. Sometimes you're going to have to work overtime. You're not going to get paid extra for that. Sometimes you're going to work weekends. Sometimes shit’s gonna hit the fan. You don't want to work with someone who whines about it. Our theory is that Apple is more likely to reward employees (and candidates) who act like the leader. If you listen to 1:00:36 - 1:02:05 in an interview with Steve Jobs, you’ll see some stark similarities to how Apple interviewers talk about the organization. In this clip, he says, “You know how many committees we have? None. We are organized like a startup.” He then describes the benefits of silos and dividing things up.Privacy and politics are the natural consequence of a place intentionally designed to be siloed and divided up and kept separate. It’s a cost that Apple accepts because the gain is increased productivity. Put people in closed systems (teams and orgs that don’t talk to other teams and orgs) and watch them get more done. This system works like blinders on a racehorse: it keeps vision focused down the track, on the goal, minimizing peripheral distraction. That’s all they need to see and they run/work faster because of it.One final aspect of Apple’s behavioral rounds is that they will ask you specific questions about relevant skills. For example, if a team works with big data, they will ask specifically about a time you have worked with large-scale distributed systems in the context of your answer. If you don’t have direct experience with the field, they will try to get as close as possible, like asking you for what tradeoffs you’ve made when choosing a storage system. These behavioral interview questions serve two purposes: showing you have had relevant experience in the context of what the team is hiring for and trying to get you to talk about a particular behavioral skill (e.g., leadership, conflict resolution).How Apple makes hiring decisionsAs evidenced by the highest chaos score, Apple doesn’t do many things in hiring consistently, across the whole company. One trend is that Apple teams rely on post-interview live discussions to make hiring decisions. This varies from somewhat informal (compared to the rest of FAANG) to laughably informal. Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“Post-onsite feedback for my org was 100% live discussions. At Apple I never had to write feedback. Which made me do more interviews. We made the decision on the same day. Everyone had to make a decision at the end of the day. Do an onsite, then at 5pm, we gather in a single meeting room, we do on the count of three: thumbs up, down, or in the middle. Then we talk after seeing the thumbs. And try to convince the people on the other side. If there’s less than 5 thumbs-up, then that might be an instant rejection. If there’s 6 or 7 or more thumbs up, the ‘thumbs up’ people try to convince the other side. Or in that same situation, the 3 or 4 thumbs down will try to convince the other side.”Because of the informal decision-making process and reliance on live discussion, managing the impressions of your interviewers is more important at Apple than at other FAANG. In these decision-making meetings, if there’s dissent, they strive for consensus. The people on one side try to convince the other side. This process can last 15-30 minutes on average; all FAANG companies say interviewers fight for candidates, but Apple tends to fight more than most of them.Because of their patterns of live-discussions and striving for consensus, Apple interviewers are more likely to fight for or against you (if your performance was on the fence) than any other FAANG, except maybe Netflix. Ultimately, the hiring manager for that particular role has the most say, which means that that’s the person you should be working to impress the most.Anecdote from an Apple Interviewer“My manager wanted to hire this person. But he failed my interview so badly. I didn't want to argue with my manager but at the same time I didn't want to work with this person. Because we are hiring people we’d work with on a daily basis. So arguments happen a lot. And in this case, I was the only ‘no’ on the board and the candidate got rejected.”Apple coding interview preparation resourcesWe’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Apple content for you!

Do anonymous mock interviews with real Netflix interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.See available timesBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Netflix’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers. Every human organization views themselves as a metaphor; Netflix doesn’t view themselves as a family like some other tech companies, they view themselves as a high-caliber sports team (in fact, Netflix calls their employees a “dream team”). They explain this metaphor themselves in their infamous culture memo. Finally, Netflix’s interview process is decentralized and team-dependent. Moreover, you can interview with multiple teams at Netflix concurrently, which can help you increase your odds of securing a job offer.Step 1: Recruiter call Please see the section above called “A note about recruiter calls” Step 2: Hiring manager screen This is a 30 minute call. A former Netflix employee called this round “Very chill, especially compared to the onsite.” This round consists of bidirectional surface-level questions. The hiring manager will also be selling you on Netflix. Hiring managers doing selling is business as usual, but in this case, it serves an additional purpose – because their onsite is by far the most intense, they have to sell harder upfront because the onsite is a bigger commitment for the candidates. Step 3: Technical phone screen The Netflix technical phone screen is a coding interview that typically lasts 45-60 minutes. There is significant inter-team variation on what these interviews cover, and the tooling you use during these interviews also varies by team,Step 4: OnsiteOnsite interview structure varies from team to team, but you’ll have roughly 8 interviews focused primarily on system design, then behavioral, and then coding.Depending on the length of the onsite, Netflix recruiting may ask you if you’d prefer to split the onsite over two days, and we recommend that you proactively ask to do that, given how taxing the behavioral and system design portions are! Netflix is the only FAANG that routinely includes 1-2 directors in their onsite loops. If your loop has two, it’ll be one director will be from your org and another from a partner org. Netflix does this to reduce bias. One director may do a system design interview, and the other will do a behavioral interview.Tip to get unstuck“Don’t be thrown off by having to talk to directors. Just stick to the principles: when you speak about technical stuff you’ve worked on, focus on scale, availability, and security. When you speak about behavioral stuff: use shared ideas from their culture deck, take accountability for your wins and failures, and demonstrate metrics and impact.”Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer“The HRBP \\[which is basically a very senior recruiting function\\] and the director would typically focus on behavioral rounds. I have also seen directors spending time (30 mins) just letting candidates ask and clarify any questions that they might have regarding the team, Netflix culture, career growth path or any other aspects. So, a strong recommendation would be to be ready with your genuine questions list and get things clarified in such interviews. Candid conversation is one of the key values at Netflix and asking genuine concerns if any is seen through good lenses, as that establishes candidates' seriousness about the role to some extent.”Netflix’s interview types in detailCodingThe technical questions Netflix asks vary from team to team. Some teams don’t ask LeetCode questions. Other teams will ask medium-difficulty LeetCode-style coding questions with a creative/practical twist.These rounds are going to change team by team, but the pattern we’ve noticed is that Netflix coding questions often come in two parts.Typically there is one question and, in scenarios where edge cases and tests are done early, say within 45 minutes, the interviewer may choose to spend some time discussing general large scale engineering concepts and distributed systems (like microservices, scalability, etc.). For instance, some expansions could be:A system design expansion on top of the coding question, such as a practical application where they ask you to apply the solution you just found to a part of their real-life systemA deep dive into a specific skill set (e.g., if this team codes in Java: they’ll have a round all about multithreading for Java specifically) For everything you need to prepare for Netflix’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Netflix coding interview preparation resources\" below.System design This is the most important round at Netflix. Coding carries the least weight, behavioral carries a lot, and system design has the most. Netflix system design rounds are highly unique and highly challenging. Netflix is to system design as Google is to coding; these technical interview rounds include the most difficult and bespoke questions.Similar to how Amazon loves Leadership Principles, Netflix loves system design so much they even throw it into coding rounds sometimes – first, you solve a LeetCode-style problem. Then they ask you to apply it to a real-world use case. That said, Netflix system design rounds are easier to prepare for if you know the patterns: Netflix loves scale. Netflix never wants to go down, and Netflix hates when things aren’t secure. Availability is super important to them; they want to ask and hear about tactics to scale systems, keep systems highly available, and maintain secure systems. At Netflix, you’re likely to see unique questions that you won’t get anywhere else, and the system design round is the part of the process that Netflix interviewers take the most pride in, so they make up hard, one-of-a-kind questions from scratch. Thematically, their questions are more likely to be focused on scaling. They also like to ask about security and availability. In fact, Netflix is more likely than the rest of FAANG to give you a system design round focused solely on security. For instance, you might get asked what you would do during a DDoS attack, and the entirety of the session will be spent drilling down into the details. And because they’re also obsessed with availability, you might get questions around backups and what to do if a service goes down. Moreover, as with their coding rounds, Netflix prefers questions with a practical application, and they’re likely to ask you about something they’re working on right now. If you research the hell out of their architecture – specifically the service that particular team is in charge of – and the other services this service interacts with, you’ll be in good shape.You’re also likely to see a “reverse system design” round, where your interviewer will ask you pointed questions about the systems you’ve worked on before, e.g., the largest scale system you’ve worked on, how did you manage it, how did you scale it, etc.Questions they most likely won’t ask are product-focused questions, such as “Design Spotify”.Tip to get unstuckLearn about Netflix’s overall architecture so you can a) speak their language, and b) build or speak of something similar (in the interview) that Netflix has already built but simpler. For the team you interview with: what’s their tech stack? What open source stuff do they do? With which other services might their service interact? That last question is most critical. If you can put forethought into how their current system works, you’ll have a huge leg up; then all you’ll need to do is discuss what you learned about their system to score a bunch of points with any of their interviewers. What tooling you use in these interviews depends on the team you’re interviewing with. Behavioral Answers to behavioral questions are almost as important as system design at Netflix. You’ll get rejected if you fail the behavioral screen.These interviews have a heavy emphasis on the candidate being a cultural fit, being able to work in a team, having curiosity, and being product minded, highly motivated individuals capable of driving products forward. A unique part of Netflix’s behavioral interview is the “Dream Team” interview. This is a slightly more intense behavioral round conducted by a director. The \"volume\" is turned up on all of the things you might see in a typical behavioral round at Netflix (scale, accountability, open communication about concerns, high risk and high reward.) Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer“Netflix doesn’t hire as much as other FAANGs, so they want to make sure you're a star. That’s what the ‘Dream Team’ interview is about.”One key thing you need to do before your Netflix behavioral interview is read their culture memo. Our interviewers tell us that if you don’t do this, you will fail the behavioral round.Anecdote from a Netflix Engineer“The culture illustrated in the culture memo is sort of accurate to how the culture at Netflix actually is, but the actual culture is less intense. Team members tend to get along really well. You don’t compete with others in your performance review like it is at companies like Facebook. We’re not ranked against peers, so people are more willing to help each other out.”Netflix will ask about impressive things you’ve done, as well as dig into your motivation (your “why”). This round will feel like you’re doing self-promotion. Typical questions will ask about your favorite project, latest project, and most significant project, as well as open-ended questions about what you’re looking for in your next role and why you’re interested in Netflix.Tip to get unstuckPromote yourself early and often in Netflix behavioral rounds. Promote yourself proactively. Metrics and impact statements are effective ways to promote yourself because they convey a sense of scale and complexity.It can be nerve-wracking to talk to a director for 45-60 minutes. It’s more nerve-wracking when, out the gate, they ask you to describe the biggest thing you’ve ever worked on. When talking to a director, it’s more important to have metrics and impact statements.How Netflix makes hiring decisions Netflix interviewers are untrained, their questions are unstandardized, their interviews are team-dependent, and their decision-making north star is “Why”. You can interview with multiple teams concurrently, effectively giving you multiple shots on goal.There’s also no specific company-wide scale for performance at Netflix. This is different from, say, Google, where all candidates are graded on the same “Strong Hire, Hire, Neutral, No Hire, Strong No-Hire” scale. Different teams have different processes, but most decisions are made based on live post-onsite discussions.Anecdote from a Netflix Interviewer“Netflix hiring decisions are black and white: pass or fail. And then you discuss if you'd be open to changing your mind. The only difference between Apple and Netflix was how they defined cultural fit. Besides that the hiring decisions were made in the same way: informal, mainly based on live discussions, binary decisions, and striving for consensus.”Tip to get unstuckImpression management is more powerful at companies that do live feedback discussions.

Do anonymous mock interviews with real Microsoft interviewers, and see exactly where you stack up.See available timesBefore we get into the details of each of these steps, here are a few general notes about Microsoft’s process, evaluation criteria, and interviewers. Microsoft lets you interview with different teams at the same time; if you want to maximize your chances interview with several of them simultaneously. Microsoft’s process is mainly (though not fully!) team-dependent. That means that while you interview for a specific team, you may not necessarily be interviewing just with people on that team. For example, sometimes you might interview with the hiring manager for a specific team, and your other interviewers will be individual contributors from other teams.Each team runs their own processes, which can vary quite a bit from team to team as well. Sometimes Microsoft bakes a quasi-team-matching activity into an interview process: where a candidate can meet multiple hiring managers in the same loop. Another variation is some candidates’ first round screens are with a hiring manager instead of a recruiter.Step 1: Recruiter callPlease see the section above called “A note about recruiter calls”Step 2: Technical interview (phone screen or a Codility quiz)Microsoft’s technical phone screen is a traditional LeetCode-style coding interview, with technical questions ranging from easy to medium. Interviewers aren’t given a rubric. Some of them get training, others don’t. They have freedom to ask whatever they want and judge your technical skills however they want in this round. If you end up getting the asynchronous Codility quiz instead, you sign on and have to answer several algorithmic questions in a short amount of time. In some ways, this is harder than the technical phone screen with the human because if you don’t pass the test cases, you get filtered out. You’re judged on several factors including: test cases, correctness, and code quality. Step 3: Onsite The onsite format can vary per org, but it typically includes the following round of interviews:One behavioral round of behavioral interview questionsTwo or three coding rounds One system design roundOne domain-specific roundMicrosoft’s interview types in detailCoding This is the most important round at Microsoft.Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“Since most engineers at Microsoft use C#, if you can, you should use C#, Java, or Python in the technical rounds. This way, your interviewer will be able to understand your code better and may even be able to help.”Microsoft usually asks LeetCode-style medium-difficulty questions in coding rounds. Interviewers get to pick their own coding questions, but, according to interviewers, Microsoft favors the following topics (in no particular order):Arrays and stringsLinked listsGraphs and treesLeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft is also a helpful resource.Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“Tree questions are most popular, e.g., various types of tree sum, tree traversals of certain orders, subtrees, etc.”Dynamic programming used to basically never happen, but now it’s a little more common. When you do get dynamic programming problems, it’s usually the classic ones like coin change, stair steps, edit distance, and various types of counting problems.Tooling for coding interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many teams use Codility.For everything you need to prepare for Microsoft’s coding interview, check out the section called \"Microsoft coding interview preparation resources\" below.System design System design is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft, and it’s sometimes conducted by a hiring manager. One idiosyncratic aspect of Microsoft’s process is their penchant for asking questions about compliance-related topics.Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“My Microsoft interview was insanely easy. I tried to step it up when I started being an interviewer at Microsoft. But then I realized that's how it has to be. Technical is like 25% of it. It’s not a generic FAANG interview. It’s more about three things: a) ‘How well does this candidate know this system they’re going to be working on?’, b) ‘How do they meet the exact needs we have on this team?’, and c) ‘Do they understand the little things we value? Like compliance, manipulating data, data pipelines, EU data processing, etc.’”Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“Microsoft is obsessed with the details of compliance. I don’t think I have seen a system that is as set up for auditing as Microsoft. Employees are asked to log so much. There’s a centralized grid system which is built into Azure. All logs are to be routed into that. This allows for centralized log spanning and auditing. Which I have not seen anywhere else.”Outside of compliance-related questions, here are examples of other system design questions you might encounter:Let's go back in time, how would you ship cargo to customers? Discuss an approach that touches on availability, latency, reliability, communication, etc.Let's say we are interested in palindromes and we want to store them durably whenever we come up with them. Design a system that lets you enter a new palindrome every time someone comes up with one, and allows users to check if a palindrome exists in a system.Assume you are a teacher and you want to test students if they know the country names correctly. You are provided a list of countries and pictures. Design a webpage + backend API that mimics a test for students to evaluate their knowledge (this would be for a full-stack role).Tooling for system design interviews is at the team’s discretion, but many Microsoft employees use Codility Canvas or Excalidraw.Domain-specific round The domain-specific round is tied for the second most important round at Microsoft. Microsoft is more likely to do these types of rounds than other FAANGs, and these rounds can feel similar to system design but involve some coding. Usually, domain-specific rounds are customized to the domain a given team works on and dives deep into that technology. So, whatever area this team is in (cloud networking, big data, etc.), that’s what they’ll ask you about. On some occasions, Microsoft customizes a round to the candidate’s skills. For example, if you’re a backend engineer, they might ask you to design an API or design a database. They also may ask you open ended trivia questions about the programming language you are most familiar with.Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“Another thing that happens in these rounds is they’ll ask you to discuss a complicated problem you have solved at your job. It's good for candidates to prepare to discuss 2-3 projects in detail: how did they implement caching, deal with scaling issues, and so on.”Finally, you may get a scenario question that’s commensurate with your skill set. For instance, if you’re a back-end engineer, you may get a question like, “Imagine you're in a team and we're building a credit card registration system. And it's used by different firms. How do you build the interface?”Behavioral This is the least important round at Microsoft: the lowest effort way to pass is to not blame your teammates, not show red flags, and stay positive.Microsoft doesn’t have a specific set of traits they’re looking for. You can expect the usual questions about your strengths and weaknesses, failure, conflicts with colleagues, projects, and lessons you’ve learned from past experiences in your career. Anecdote from a Microsoft Interviewer“A lot of people struggle with ‘What are your top 2 strengths and weaknesses?’ probably because they are trying to make up an answer on the spot. Good to prep answers to typical behavioral questions in advance.”Ultimately, they are screening for three soft skills: positivity, ownership, and communication. They want to hire friendly people who can do the work and not blame others. This is not Apple or Netflix, where they want a particular flavor of personality, or where they ask interviewers to hire candidates they’d like to befriend. It’s more neutral.Behavioral rounds can sometimes have a coding component as well. When this happens, it might be an easy/medium-difficulty 20-min LeetCode-style problem. How Microsoft makes hiring decisionsInterviewers grade candidates on different scales, depending on the team. Some orgs have an asynchronous feedback process, other orgs rely on live discussion, and still-other orgs do both. Some orgs have rubrics, and others don’t. Here’s how a rubric looks at one org:Junior: Has growth mindset, seeks to understand ideasSenior: Drives self development, models openness, failure is okay, open to different ideasPrincipal: Consistently challenges group thinking towards productive discussionMicrosoft coding interview preparation resourcesHere are a few more interview tips and resources to help you prep for a software developer or software engineer interview at Microsoft.Microsoft interviewers can ask whatever questions they want, yet some interviewers repeat questions, so LeetCode’s Top Questions for Microsoft is somewhat helpful.Study up on the services the team you’re interviewing with uses.Ask your recruiter for specifics about your rounds. If you get nothing helpful, then practice practical questions, LeetCode-style questions, and domain-specific questions.In addition, we’ve aggregated a bunch of useful Microsoft content for you! We have replays of candidates doing mock interviews with Microsoft interviewers, long-form solutions to common Microsoft questions, and deep dives into technical topics that tend to come up in Microsoft interviews.Microsoft interview replaysBelow are a series of mock interview replays, conducted by Microsoft interviewers on our platform.

Our community and our data puts us in a unique position to share Amazon Leadership Principles advice, tips and tricks. If you’re studying for an upcoming Amazon Leadership Principles interview, use our expertise. It’ll give you a serious edge.About interviewing.iointerviewing.io is a mock interview practice platform. In our lifetime, we've hosted close to 100K mock interviews, conducted primarily by senior engineers from FAANG.We have the recordings from these mock interviews, as well as post-interview feedback and outcomes, which lets us perform some cool and useful analysis!Best of all, interviewing.io lets you book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and many more.Book yours todayYouTube: Watch “How interviewing.io Helps Engineers Land Jobs” Though most of the interviews we've hosted have focused on algorithms/data structures or systems design, we've recently started offering other types of practice as well, including Amazon-specific behavioral interviews. We've hosted close to 500 Amazon behavioral interviews to date. How to use the Amazon Leadership Principles guideWe intentionally structured this guide as two separate parts. Part 1 introduces Amazon's Leadership Principles, discusses high-level strategies, and gives you a high-level view of our approach to the Amazon Leadership Principles. Part 2 will teach you exactly how to answer Amazon Leadership Principles questions, and we'll provide you with a detailed plan so you'll know exactly what to do to excel in your interview. Where you start reading depends on what you want. If you're interviewing at Amazon tomorrow, don't panic—just jump to Part 2: What to expect, what to avoid, and what to do during an Amazon Leadership Principles interview. Otherwise, begin with Part 1 to gain the foundational knowledge that will help you practice most effectively.With that being said, our insight does have some limitations. It's worth noting, for example, that the majority of job interviews we looked at for this project were with L6/SDE III candidates, so our data set is skewed toward senior engineers. (For reference, an L6/SDE III at Amazon is roughly equivalent to an L5/Sr. SWE at Google.)PART 1:Amazon Leadership Principles ExplainedBefore we dive into specific interview questions, it’s important to understand what the Amazon Leadership Principles are and what they mean for Amazon employees and team members.What Amazon LikesDirect challengesShowing customer obsession (all the time)Big lossesNo answer (more so than a bad answer)Stories that go in a perfect full circleVSWhat Amazon DislikesConflict rabbit holesNot enough impact and metricsNot enough focus on individual contributionSaying LPs out loudMisunderstanding \"Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit\"What are Amazon’s Leadership Principles (LPs)?In a nutshell, Leadership Principles (LPs) are the 16 values Amazon cares the most about.Below we list the 16 Leadership Principles developed by Jeff Bezos and give a brief overview of each. We’ll also tell you how that value impacts the work environment and share some Leadership Principles questions which could probe for each LP. You’ll notice some of the questions seem irrelevant to the LP they’re listed under; that’s because some Amazonians intentionally design tricky questions. Don’t use these as a way to guess which LP a question is aimed at. For now, use them to start building a model in your head of what these interviews actually look like.1. Customer ObsessionCustomer obsession is about giving the customer what they want before they know they want it. It’s a business-driver; engineers who are obsessed with delighting customers will churn out new features faster. Since Amazonians are encouraged to find ways to delight the customer before they know they’d like to be delighted, this promotes repeat business, effectiveness, and innovation.Example “Customer Obsession” questions:Tell me about a time when you strongly disagreed with your manager or peer on something you considered very important to the business.To try to meet the high expectations of our customers, we sometimes promise more than we can deliver. Tell me about a time when you overcommitted yourself or your company.2. Invent and SimplifyAmazon rewards risk-taking. They push the bounds of what’s possible from cloud to e-commerce. They want big ideaters with business savvy; engineers at Amazon are encouraged to innovate as well as cut costs. As big as they grow, they still keep it simple: AWS is the biggest cloud provider in the world, yet Amazon.com strives to be their number one client. That’s an example of a simple solution to a complex problem, which is what this Leadership principle is all about.Example “Invent and Simplify” questions:Tell me about a time when you didn’t meet customer’s needs.Give me an example of a complex problem you solved with a simple solution.3. Learn and Be CuriousVirtually every tech company’s marketing about their culture will include something like this. Curiosity drives learning. Amazon wants smart people who are never satisfied; they want you to always be learning. They promote taking big swings even if you end up missing. You can’t learn from your mistakes without curiosity.Example “Learn and Be Curious” questions: Give me an example of a mission or goal you didn’t think was achievable. We all have things about ourselves we'd like to improve on at work. Give me an example of something that you've worked on to improve your overall work effectiveness. 4. Insist on the Highest StandardsOver the years, Jeff Bezos has repeated the mantra “Every day is day one.” He wants employees who approach every day as if they haven’t accomplished anything yet. That is a very high standard. Another reflection of Amazon’s high standards is how challenging and rewarding it is to become one of their most trusted interviewers, which is called a “Bar Raiser”. A good portion of those who apply don’t make the cut and if you make it your promotion packet gets a big boost. A Bar Raiser can veto the votes of all other interviewers in an onsite round. Those are high standards.Example “Insist on the Highest Standards” questions:Tell me about a time when you had to work with a difficult customer or user. Tell me about a time when you used external trends to improve your own company's products or services. 5. Deliver ResultsAmazon aims for market domination. This is a company which values the “what” over the “why” and the “how”; they don’t care about how you get there or why you get there as much as they care about you getting there. You get there. In their interviews, they expect candidates to move quickly and without any hints, and they have coding questions on the easier side because they want to get to the optimal outcome as soon as possible.Example “Deliver Results” questions:Could you tell me about a time where you were working on a project where you were working with another person. Over time, that person lessened their involvement in the project and you had to take on more responsibility.Tell me about a strategic decision you had to make without clear data or benchmarks.6. Strive to be the Earth’s Best EmployerIf you’re a software engineer, you won’t get asked about this.7. Dive DeepLike most tech companies, Amazon wants decisions to be made based on data; to implement an idea, you’ll need to show data. Where Amazon is different is this gritty mentality of “get the fricking job done”. Diving deep is essentially pulling yourself up by the bootstraps and making it happen. It’s also about developing a cultural attitude of people who are willing to get their hands dirty in order to win.Example “Dive Deep” questions:Tell me about a time when you had to communicate a change in direction that you anticipated people would have concerns with.Tell me about a time where you were thrown into a project where you had no experience in.8. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit This is the most misunderstood Leadership Principle. What it doesn’t mean is “I’ll stand up for myself. Then do it my way regardless of what you say.” What it actually means is “I verbalize the things I disagree on. Then I commit to taking action. Whether it was the action you or I proposed doesn’t matter: I’ll commit to following through on something.” This is also probably the most infamous LP, and it seems to be part of the reason for Amazonian interviewers' higher than normal level of intensity. Example “Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit” questions:Often, we must make decisions as a group. Give me an example of a time you committed to a group decision even though you disagreed.Tell me about a time where you disagreed with a coworker or PM or manager because you believed the decision they wanted to make was wrong for the customer.9. Success and Scale Bring Broad ResponsibilityUsually only eng managers get asked about this one, so we’ll skip it.10. OwnershipTake accountability. Do all of, if not more than, what the job requires. The intention is to stimulate taking risks, having pride, and sacrificing for the business. Amazon wants folks who take big bets, hold themself to high expectations, and put in the hard work. This is one of the reasons they place a higher value on focusing on their individual contribution when answering Leadership Principles questions.Example “Ownership” questions:Describe a time when you took on work outside of your comfort area.Describe a situation where you made an important business decision without consulting your manager.11. Are Right, A LotThis is another value that adds to the energy of a Leadership Principles interview: this is about competition. You have to know your stuff if you’re right, a lot. You also have to be willing to assert your point and back it up with all that data you dove deep for. This LP doesn’t mean Amazonians can’t mess up. They openly encourage candidates to describe times they were wrong, especially when they were wrong on a big gamble. Their ethical decision tree would look something like: Step 1: Dominate. Step 2: Did you dominate? If yes, proceed to success. If not, you better have risked enough to learn if and how domination is possible.Example “Are Right, A Lot” questions:Tell me about a time when you did not effectively manage your projects and something did not get completed on time.Tell me about a time you wouldn’t compromise on achieving a great outcome when others felt something was good enough.12. Hire and Develop the BestDomination requires finding great players and weeding out the subpar players. They’re the only FAANG company that has a formal title for their “best” interviewers: Bar Raisers. Not only does Amazon compete against other tech companies to find the “best” talent but they also compete with themselves. You can interview with multiple teams simultaneously; it’s a dog-eat-dog world at Amazon and that includes dogs in the same pack.Example “Hire and Develop the Best” questions:Tell me about a time when you received negative feedback.Describe a time when you improved morale and productivity on your team.13. Think BigAmazon has a proven track record with huge ambition, large bets, and rapid expansion to new markets. Going to the moon, for one. Knowing your destination is one thing. It’s another level for your destination to be in the clouds (not an AWS joke, we swear). It’s about having a grand vision of the future so they can achieve those high standards.Example “Think Big” questions:Give an example of a creative idea you had that proved really difficult to implement.Tell me about a time when you encouraged a team member or organization to take a big risk.14. Bias for ActionYou can’t take over the world if you don’t act. You might have the best idea to refactor the codebase in your head, but if it never moves towards implementation, it’s worthless. A straightforward way to make employees more productive is to openly encourage them to produce. Amazon’s bias against inaction affects their interview style: they’re looking for candidates who move fast without hints, who seek market domination, and who deliver results.Example “Bias for Action” questions:Give me an example of a calculated risk that you have taken where speed was critical.Tell me about a time where you were the first one to take action on something.15. FrugalityAmazon is one of the rare companies who openly flaunts being frugal. Since when is “cutting costs” sexy? When it’s said by a group of the terminators who want to dominate the world, that’s when. Amazon wants you to not only figure out how to go to the moon, they want you to cut costs while you do it. One way to impress Amazon in the interview is to talk about the decisions you made in the past which saved the company money. You can learn how to do that in a later section of this guide called “How to practice for Leadership Principles.”Example “Frugality” questions:Tell me about a time you pushed back on a deadline.Give me an example of how you have helped save costs or eliminate waste within your role or organization.16. Earn TrustThis is one of the rare Leadership Principles which is not about competition. It’s about cooperation. If you want to demonstrate cooperation, focus on how you understood the other person’s perspective. A difference of opinion is natural and healthy. This LP is about showing you know how to repair: either reactively after or proactively before a difference of opinion.Example “Earn Trust” questions:Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with a colleague or manager.Describe a time when you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.You can read more about how Amazon defines these LPs here. Amazon's interview process involves a) behavioral interview rounds and b) technical interview rounds with a few behavioral questions thrown in. The behavioral questions will all focus on your work history. Importantly, Amazon will decide whether or not to hire you and how much responsibility to give you based partly on how well you demonstrate their Leadership Principles when you discuss your work history.What Amazon assesses is consistent between interviewers. Each interviewer will be assigned 1-3 LPs to look for when interviewing you. They're searching for signals on whether you: meet the bar, raise the bar, or are below the bar (for their assigned LPs). But how Amazon conducts the behavioral round varies widely. Our research has shown that if you were to observe sessions of 10 different LP interviewers, you would discover that each interviewer has their own way of determining a candidate's fit. One interviewer might ask more questions on fewer topics, while another interviewer may do the opposite. Complicating matters, upon observing the same behavior, different interviewers will likely perceive different signals. Notably, there is no consensus on what makes a good answer good.\"There is no clear rubric for what type of answer ‘meets or raises the bar.' The evaluation is subjective, and it relies on the interviewer's interpretation of the problem and solution.\"interviewing.io interviewer from AmazonAlthough you might find this degree of uncertainty intimidating, we'll show you how you can actually use this uncertainty to your advantage and score additional points during your interview.How to approach the Amazon Leadership Principles interviewMany candidates treat their interview like a standardized test. But doing so is a serious and costly mistake.A standardized test is unimpressionable, fixed, and objective. Information only flows one way, any modification of structure or content is rejected, and correct answers aren't debatable. But, as we showed above, the individualized approach of Amazon's interviewers makes it clear: Amazon's behavioral round is not a standardized test—it's a game.A game is malleable, dynamic, and subjective. In other words, the behavioral interview is a lot like Calvinball. In Calvinball, “While the objective of the game is to win, there is no real way to determine what winning is” (source). That means that you can change the rules. You can mold the field of play to fit your strengths. You're limited solely by your imagination.These types of games are influenced by cognitive biases, configurable to your advantage, and filled with judgment calls. But, more than anything else, the biggest difference between a standardized test and a game is that the latter involves your counterpart (the interviewer) making up the rules as they go along—just like you.\"25% of SDEs who pass the technical bar are disqualified due to behavioral concerns.\"interviewing.io interviewer from AmazonWhy interview preparation mattersMany engineers wrongly assume that they don't need to prepare for a behavioral interview. They believe they can wing it by simply talking about their past experience because they assume it's something they're already intimately familiar with. However, winging it won't cut it in Amazon's behavioral interview—it's a particularly common failure pattern we see on our platform.Amazon is known for its competitive workplace culture, and most Amazonians seem to get satisfaction from making a behavioral round intense, much more so than most interviewers at other companies. Unprepared candidates are prone to get rattled by the somewhat confrontational, challenging style of these interviewers, causing their performance to suffer as a result.To avoid that same fate and actually excel in the interview, you'll need to learn about what Amazon cares about (the LPs) and discover how to respond to their tricky questions without getting flustered. Do that, and you'll increase your odds of both getting hired and receiving a higher level of responsibility.\"I wish more candidates would prepare well in advance for our behavioral questions. I wish they knew the questions' patterns and were prepared to speak about their experience in an effective way.\"interviewing.io interviewer from AmazonHigh-level strategy to frame your Leadership Principles interviewIn this section, we'll teach you a strategy that will increase your odds of success while lowering your stress. We think it's important to explain why you should use this strategy and how we analyzed and bucketed these LPs to maximize your hit rate.The most common pitfall to avoidWhen it comes to preparing for Amazon's interview, one popular strategy is to guess which LP a question is asking about before answering the question. Unfortunately, there are 16 different LPs to keep track of, so your odds of guessing correctly are low; your interviewer may ask tricky, confusing, or challenging questions that are designed to push back, probe, or catch you off guard; and you can't predict if the interviewer will even detect signal of the LP you're trying to convey.There has to be a simpler way to crack this, and we think we've found it.Put Customer Obsession above all elseIf we can determine what concepts these LPs have in common, then you can simply show signal for a bucket of LPs instead of attempting to laser focus your answer on one LP. This will make it easier for you to prepare for the interview and also increase your odds of success.We spent a lot of time analyzing the 16 LPs, identifying their shared themes, and placing them into buckets. Searching for the most efficient and effective way to group the LPs, we discovered that every LP has one common denominator: customer obsession. This is Amazon's favorite value. It's their north star. Without customer obsession, Amazon wouldn't be Amazon.But if all 16 LPs can be reduced down to one concept, then what's the point of following the status quo and guessing which LP a question is asking about? Because, technically, wouldn't the answer be customer obsession every time? Yes, and that's our point. Though it may be tempting to do otherwise, you should ignore the urge to guess which specific LP lies beneath a question. It's more likely to hurt than it is to help.Instead, broadcast the idea that you are obsessed with delighting customers. Signal this idea early and often; make this your new default system. In such a generalized interview format with so much subjectivity, you want to cover as wide of a surface area as possible. Demonstrating customer obsession is the closest thing we've found to a cheat code.PART 2:What to expect, what to avoid, and what to do during an Amazon Leadership Principles interviewNow that we've explained why you should condense the LPs into a single bucket (customer obsession), it's time to learn everything you need to know in order to craft your own ideal answers.What to expect when answering questions about Amazon Leadership PrinciplesExpect your interviewer or hiring manager to directly challenge your answers. Here's an excerpt from a tech lead interview at Amazon. Let's take a look at how it flows.EXAMPLE QUESTION:\"How do you make sure you're focused on the right deliverables when you have several competing priorities?\"1ST FOLLOW-UP QUESTION:\"Can you tell me about a time when you did not manage priorities and something fell through the cracks?\"2ND FOLLOW-UP QUESTION:\"What could you have done better?\"3RD FOLLOW-UP QUESTION:\"I don't think you answered the question. I think you're answering a more generic question. I'm asking you to tell me about a time when your process for competing priorities didn't work.\"The topic of the initial Question is ambiguous: there's no known optimal solution for managing priorities. The 1st Follow-up Question is about failure. Essentially, so far, the interviewer has said, “Hey, give me your philosophy on a subject for which there's no consensus,” followed by, “Okay, now tell me how that philosophy of yours is imperfect.” That's a direct challenge.The 2nd Follow-up Question is also about failure. And the 3rd Follow-up Question is another direct challenge. In fact, you might never see a stronger direct challenge than the 3rd Follow-up Question. This is classic Amazon. Ambiguity and failure can be intimidating enough on their own, but Amazon doesn't stop there. They turn up the heat to test your ability to handle pressure. Four common mistakes to avoid when answering Amazon interview questionsIn addition to learning what to expect in an interview, it's important to identify common mistakes that candidates make so you can avoid them in your own interview. Here, we will focus on the mistakes themselves.Most Common Mistakes in Terms of ContentIn addition to learning what to expect in an interview, it's important to identify common mistakes that candidates make so you can avoid them in your own interview. Here, we will focus on the mistakes themselves.MISTAKE #1Not enough impact or metricsThe most common critical feedback given by interviewers is either: “It would have been better if you described more impact” or “It would have been better if you mentioned more metrics.”Amazon likes business and scale. An answer without impact means Amazon can't get a read on your business acumen. An answer without metrics gives Amazon no way to determine scale.One reason candidates don't mention impact or metrics is because they think they can only use impact or metrics that are accurate with 100% certainty. Lastly, one additional reason people fail to include impact or metrics is that they simply aren't sure how to find them. (If you want to learn how to find impact and metrics right now, then jump to Step 1 of How to Practice for LP.)MISTAKE #2Falling down rabbit holes when asked about conflictCandidates frequently get tripped up when asked questions about conflict. We can't tell you how to avoid every possible pitfall, but we can tell you how to avoid the most common one: Trying to prove that you were right.Two things that interviewers absolutely do not want to hear when you're speaking about conflict:Why your X approach was better than your colleague's Y approach.The minute details of your X approach and of your colleague's Y approach.This is where many people get stuck. It doesn't matter who had the better technical approach. Don't try to justify to the interviewer that you were right and your colleague was wrong. Avoid this trap.You may have spent a lot of time thinking about this, but that doesn't mean you need to share a lot about it. Once again, your goal is not to prove that you were correct. Therefore, you shouldn't speak at length about why a proxy server was the best solution or explain the usability drawbacks of changing the hosting environment. Less is more in this case. If they want more detail, they'll ask about it in their follow-up questions.Some of the other common ways people fail during questions about conflict: rambling for five minutes before describing the actual conflict, talking about a conflict from 10 years ago, focusing on the intensity of the conflict instead of what happened during the conflict, and speaking about a conflict where the topic seems trivial for someone at their level.MISTAKE #3Not focusing on individual contribution\"When talking about your projects, most of your words should be about ‘I' not ‘We.' Your answer should mainly be about your individual contribution.\"interviewing.io interviewer from AmazonAccording to our research, the third most common reason engineers fail interviews is a lack of focus on their individual contributions when discussing their work history. Typical feedback from interviewers looked like this: “I got an understanding of what the project was about and what work was involved in general, but I couldn't really get a sense of what you did.”Again, Amazonian and non-Amazonian interviewers both deduct points when a candidate fails to focus on their individual contribution. But some speculate that Amazonians dock more points than other companies when someone misses the mark here. Don't get caught up in an in-depth walk-through of how the technology works, the specific structure of the business units, or the intricacies of what everybody else was doing. Say “I”!MISTAKE #4Saying Leadership Principles out loudIf you're the candidate, don't recite LPs out loud. It sounds clunky and unnatural.Not OkSaying “customer obsession”Saying “deliver results”VSOkSaying “delighting users is important”Saying “get stuff done”Takeaway: you can riff, but don't “copy and paste.”We've focused so far on the most common reasons candidates lose points in an Amazon behavioral interview, but now let's take a look at strategies you can use to make a positive impact.Tips for a successful Amazon behavioral interviewNow that you know what to avoid during your interview, let&s dive into some best practices and tips for passing your behavioral interview with flying colors.Beat the drum with customer obsession—the most important Leadership PrincipleAs we mentioned earlier, all of the LPs have one common denominator: customer obsession. It's never a bad time to demonstrate a keen focus on meeting customers' needs; to borrow a quote from Wedding Crashers: “It's like pizza, baby—it's good no matter what!To make your answers stronger, you can show signal for customer obsession in places where it doesn't seem to apply. Take this question, for example: “Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a colleague or a manager. What was the situation? How did you resolve it?”ANSWER AWithout customer obsession framingI had to organize and refactor the codebase. And I thought object-oriented programming was the best approach. But one of my teammates did not buy in. I tried to explain the benefits but did not sway him. I wanted to get the work done, so I ended up going ahead with the approach he proposed. At the end of the day, delivering the feature was more important than proving my point to stick with the object-oriented approach. I made peace with my teammate and went ahead with his approach.VSANSWER AWith customer obsession framingI had to reorganize the codebase and refactor the codebase. And I thought object-oriented programming was the best approach. But my teammate didn't buy in. For the sake of pushing something to prod quicker, we ended up going with his approach. But looking back on it, I wish I would have fought more for the object-oriented approach, and the reason is because user experience is really important to me. If we had the codebase nicely structured with object-oriented design and patterns and hierarchy, it'd make it way easier to maintain and more robust and less buggy. So later on we could develop cool new features for customers and push them out quicker.Data collected from a representative sample of Amazon behavioral interviews showed us what to do and what to avoid during an interview.No answer is often better than a bad answerIt's all right to say: “I don't have an answer for that,” or “I can't think of an example for this question.” In fact, interviewers don't expect you to have an answer for every single question they ask. Unless it's a question your interviewer thinks is insanely common, you're not going to lose points for passing on one question. Obviously, you don't want to dodge four behavioral interview questions in a row. But, overall, no answer is better than a bad answer.\"It's better to share no example than a bar-lowering example. For instance, if the interviewer asks you to share a time you ‘Insisted on the Highest Standards,' and you talk about code formatting one source file, that is almost definitely a negative mark against you. It would be better to share nothing at all.\"interviewing.io interviewer from AmazonThe most misunderstood Amazon leadership principleHave backbone; disagree and commit is not about making people do it your way. This is the most misunderstood LP. It's easy to over-focus on the competitive traits Amazon likes; determined to show they're a good fit for Amazon, candidates seem to spin their past work history to make it seem like they're ultra-competitive.If it's impossible to do it your way, are you able to go ahead with someone else's plan? Or do you block? If it's impossible to do it your way, accommodating a conflicting idea after you've clearly asserted your point is perfectly reasonable. To showcase this in an interview, you might describe how you told your colleague:\"Hey, I don't agree. And I don't agree for these reasons. I think it's not going to work. However, for the sake of getting the work done, I'm on board. And down the road, if things aren't going as planned, then we can circle back and revisit this discussion.\"Follow four rules when speaking about conflictWhen answering questions about conflict, do your best to clearly describe the conflict you're referencing, ensure the conflict is pertinent to the level of the job you're applying for, choose a conflict that resulted in significant discussion or back and forth, and stick to the facts.RULE #1Clearly articulate the conflict in the first few seconds of your answer.Don't make your interviewer wait. After you share the conflict, pause briefly to let it sink in.EXAMPLE:\"In my current role, a conflict occurred over choosing how to integrate a third-party software. The conflict was: my manager and I couldn't agree on an approach.\"RULE #2Make sure the topic of a conflict is relevant to your level.A topic relevant to a junior engineer is something like choosing variable names. For senior engineers, it'd be about something more significant such as deciding how to design the architecture or choosing one database over another.RULE #3Choose actual conflicts, not potential conflicts.A conflict is a disagreement drawn out over time. If there wasn't much discussion about it or time didn't pass while it persisted, then it probably wasn't a conflict. If this is the case, it was more of a “potential conflict that got resolved quickly.” If it wasn't a conflict, then don't position it as one.Example of a potential conflict that got resolved quickly“They said X. I said Y. And then they said, ‘Oh, you're right. Actually, Y is better.' And then we did Y.”VSExample of an actual conflict“They said X. I said Y. And then time passed. They still said X and I still said Y. So, I did research on X and Y. More time passes. I showed this research to get buy-in from some Important People. Then I showed my research to the People Who Said X. More time passes. The People Who Said X weren't convinced until Z happened. Then the People Who Said X got on board and said Y.”RULE #4Focus on what happened and stick to the facts.Define the conflict, describe how the conflict was resolved, share the steps you took to resolve it, and state the outcome.EXAMPLE:\"One conflict I had with my manager was about integrating a third-party API. They thought this service would improve performance. My research showed it improved performance marginally but complicated maintenance significantly. After gaining support from the team lead, I walked my manager through the data flows. They weren't convinced; however, they were more open to the idea. At the urging of myself and the team lead, the manager took it to one of their stakeholders who agreed that the long-term maintenance costs were too high to justify using this service. This led to us not integrating the third-party service that had been proposed.\"Share experiences where you took a big lossPart of the definition of earn trust says that Amazon wants leaders who are “vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing,” so don't be afraid of telling Amazon how you've struck out swinging for the fences. You're encouraged to highlight the benefit that getting this “win” would have brought to your team. And, to give you an idea of the big-scale losses they want to hear about, you can talk about failures that resulted in losing a contract, losing future business, or losing a lot of money.Questions the candidate asks the interviewer are an opportunity to show signalGreat candidates demonstrate signal in places most candidates might overlook, such as the questions they ask the interviewer when wrapping up.Question from the candidate:\"Let's say you have a user who used to use the Alexa services when they were a new user, but now they don't use the Alexa services anymore. How do you collect the data to understand what went wrong, so you can improve user experience? Most users are going to ignore surveys, so how do you learn about stuff like what features they didn't like?\"By framing it around user experience, this question broadcasts customer obsession. It's crucial to take advantage of every opportunity to broadcast signal, so don't ignore the importance of asking questions in a strategic way.How to practice for a Leadership Principles interview in six stepsAn average candidate will go online, get a list of behavioral interview questions, immediately start typing answers to the questions, and maybe get some feedback from friends.The primary error here is implementing a solution before understanding the problem. Another error here is the lack of a robust QA process between the initial answer you type out and the answers you say in an interview. What are the chances you got it right the first time? What are the odds that your original answer left a bunch of data unsaid? And what if the data you're leaving behind is better than what you wrote down in your first draft?Another mistake is that friends often go easy on you and frequently lack the knowledge or skill to give you actionable feedback. When learning from friends, the best case scenario is you learn less than you should, and the worst case is you learn the wrong stuff entirely.There are six steps you should follow to prepare for Amazon Leadership Principles interview so you can beat the game.1 Extract the raw dataApproach the raw data extraction like a brain dumpA brain dump is “the act or an instance of comprehensively and uncritically expressing and recording one's thoughts and ideas (as on a particular topic)” (Source). Don't worry yet about the quality of what you extract, and don't focus too much on how it all sounds. Your goal is just to get everything written/typed out.Prepare for follow-up questions.For more than 40 years the STAR framework has remained the de facto standard method for structuring answers to behavioral questions. STAR doesn't protect you from an ornery engineer drilling down for 15 minutes on some obscure detail about a project you did two years ago. So, how do you prepare for follow-up questions? Grill yourself until you've extracted enough data. You can either spend a reasonable amount of time grilling yourself before the interview, or you can spend an unreasonable amount of time getting grilled during the interview.\"Interviewers may spend 10-15 minutes on a single point, asking multiple follow-up questions and going deep into the point.\"interviewing.io interviewer from AmazonSelf ReflectionFor each project you've worked on in the past few years, ask yourself these questions:What business problem was this project supposed to solve?What were the greatest technical challenges? (Usually, the more interesting ones are the ones you didn't expect)What approach did you take?What are the drawbacks to the approach you chose?What alternative approaches did you consider?How did you compare the approaches?What tradeoffs did you consider?How did you profile them?How did you compare scalability for each?What was your vision for how each technology would evolve over time?What were the functional challenges?Did you have to do something faster than usual?Or with less resources than usual? How new was the subject matter to you?How many other teams or stakeholders did you work with on this?How much pre-established process was there in place for your role?What were the interpersonal challenges?What did you learn?Discover some gems.Grilling yourself will give you a ton of data. But most of that data won't be impressive to an outsider. Much of it might be muck. But that's OK! Within the muck, there will be some gems, pieces of well-crafted language. After you've uncovered these gems, search them for any signal of customer obsession. Gems don't need to have that signal. However, a gem with any of these signals is inherently a more valuable gem because it's tailor-made for Amazon.Example GemsFor each project you've worked on in the past few years, ask yourself these questions:I found a security vulnerability in our cloud infrastructure which saved the company 3 million dollars in annual customer support costs.The main project I worked on for the last two years was a bot detection project to stop fraud. As a part of my research, I spoke with the 10+ teams (including some Staff-level engineers) who had attempted to solve this problem but failed. I noticed they all did the same thing - they made an assumption that hackers aren't always evolving. These other teams were implementing 1 idea every 6 months or 1 idea per year. My team (myself and a data scientist) was able to implement 5 ideas per week. So, in some sense, we were moving more than 125X faster than the other engineers who had previously worked on this problem. We ended up solving the problem, getting some patents, and saving the company a bunch of money.This is something that I learned the first time I built my own user authentication from scratch. Any way you authenticate users, there are always going to be security risks.I made a software application that controls a very fancy refrigerator. I wrote 5-10k lines of code for this project. The most challenging part was linking up three different aspects (which were all over the stack) to talk to each other. Low-level hardware interfacing, which was all wrapped up. And then there's the back end logic that controls the data ingest and data logging and data processing. Lastly, there's the front end which is a graphical application with live plots and switches and dials and stuff.Find a bunch of metrics and impact.You don't need to be 100% certain about the numbers; that's unreasonable. When it comes to your work history, especially for companies you no longer work for, your best guess is good enough.Metrics and ImpactIf you want to find metrics and impact for anything you've built, you can ask yourself questions such as:How large was its dataset or how many rows of data were analyzed to make it?How many devices/users did it launch to or will it launch to?How many engineering hours did it save? How many non-engineering hours did it save? How often (how many times per year) will these hours be saved? What is the cost of those yearly hours?How much money is processed by it?How much more accurate or effective was it than a given benchmark?How much was efficiency or productivity increased by it?What did users or colleagues say about it?2Frame the dataWhat is the process to turn your raw data into something polished for an interview?You have your raw data. Next, you have to figure out how you want to frame the data, then you apply the data to the frame you chose, then you see what story the data is telling, and then see if someone else can understand the story. To begin, let's observe a perfect answer that you can emulate. This will become your frame. Example of a perfect answer to an LP question (i.e., your frame)We listened to hundreds of interview responses to find this perfect LP answer. First, we are going to demonstrate why it is such an effective answer. Then we encourage you to listen to the answer in its entirety.A great answer goes in a perfect, full circle.The candidate's answer starts with a key statement of the problem and ends with a summary of how he solved the problem. When you craft stories that go in a perfect, full circle (from problem to solution), your impact is baked into the answer.Speak in a way that both an expert and an idiot can understand.Albert Einstein said: “You don't really understand you examine the answer, notice how simple his word choice is. Every word in the sentence is necessary, yet there are no words you have to google to understand.Focus on individual contribution.Most of his answer focuses on the actions he took (i.e., his “individual contribution”). Because of this, he avoids getting bogged down by minutiae, such as technical jargon, details on how these teams and business units work, the specifics of the approach they took in this architecture, or explaining how this particular technology functions.Hear the perfect LP answer for yourself (don't mind the sharks 😉 )3 IterateNow that you have your frame, you can build answers atop the frame to see how they fit. Doing this will help you find out what works and what doesn't.Talk through your answers.The best way to practice is with an experienced interviewer who has domain expertise. If that's not available to you, then you'll want to use our example questions, record some answers, and analyze your own responses. Overall, this isn't a bad choice, but it isn't as helpful as practicing with an expert because feedback from yourself is limited by blind spots.Use gems, metrics, and impact as much as possible.It's impossible to overdo it with these three skills. There's nowhere in an answer that they can't be used effectively. Get comfortable using them. Experiment. Find what works for you.Clearly answer the question and demonstrate your passion for delighting customers.As we proved earlier, there's little to no value in guessing the underlying LP or attempting to aim your answer at one specific LP. Instead, practice answering each question clearly and broadcasting your obsession with making customers happy.Make 80% of your answer about individual contribution.Focus on making “I” statements (as in, “actions that I took”). This leaves 20% of your answer to cover “everything else.” Some examples of “everything else” are: a) “We” (or “actions we took”), b) “How stuff works in this company (or team or organization),” and c) “little things worth mentioning.”4 Refine the stuff that worksNow that you have practiced giving answers with some framing, you should have a better idea of what works. At this point, you can refine the story your data is telling. This means (partially or fully) scripting out your answers. How much to script depends on your preferences; some people prefer room for improvisation, while others would rather know exactly what they're going to say.Once you have a basic outline of the key points to hit, or the answer scripted out in full, you can measure what story your data is telling. To achieve this, consider how much signal for customer obsession is found in your answers.Finally, it's time to benchmark how effective you are at conveying your story to someone else.5 Go from good to greatGet actionable feedback from actual Amazon interviewers.Admittedly, we're biased, and we think you should use the interviewers on interviewing.io 🙃 Mock interviewing with experts will take you from good to great because it accurately simulates the environment of an interview. It's just like the real interview but without negative consequences; think of it as a proxy server for your job search. You get what you need (actionable feedback) from a reliable source (an Amazon interviewer) and there's no risk involved (you can't get rejected).Schedule a mock interview6Adopt the Amazon mindsetEmbrace the fire.In the spirit of competition, Amazon turns up the heat to see how you react to the flame. Expect direct challenges. When it happens, stay cool. Don't forget: it's not a standardized test; it's a game. And in order to beat the game, there's one thing that we want to make sure we're on the same page about…Amazon Leadership Principles interview question examplesMost Amazon behavioral questions fall into one of 5 buckets. In this question bank we will define the 5 buckets and give you a few example questions in each bucket.Bucket #1: Technical problem solvingIf you ignore the “spin” some of these questions have on them (complexity, simplicity, novelty, etc.), these questions are straightforward; this bucket is about how you solve technical problems.Tell me about your project which was the toughest in terms of technical challenges.Give me an example of a complex problem you solved with a simple solution. What made the problem complex? How do you know your solution addressed the problem?Give me an example of a time you proposed a novel approach to a problem. What was the problem and why did it require a novel approach? Was your approach successful?Bucket #2: Learning (and failure)These questions ask you about times you learned lessons. Sometimes lessons are learned through research you did or curiosities you followed. Sometimes lessons are learned from mistakes you made (you can define failure as “knowledge gained through first-hand experience.”)How do you approach learning new technologies?Give me an example of a significant professional failure. What led you to making the wrong decision? What did you learn from this situation?We all have things about ourselves we'd like to improve on at work. Give me an example of something that you've worked on to improve your overall work effectiveness. What resources did you identify to help you develop? What was the impact?Tell me about a time when you were wrong.Bucket #3: Getting stuff (for the business) doneThese questions are about your ability to achieve desired outcomes for the business.Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond for a customer. Why did you do it? How did the customer respond? What was the outcome?Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility. Why was it important? What was the outcome?​​Tell me about a time when you had to deliver something at a very tight timeline.Bucket #4: Interpersonal conflictThis is the most discussed bucket of Amazon questions. It's about conflicts with other people.Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with a colleague or manager.What was the situation and how did you resolve that?Tell me about a time where you disagreed with a coworker or PM or manager because you believed the decision they wanted to make was wrong for the customer.Tell me about a time when you strongly disagreed with your manager or peer on something you considered very important to the business.Bucket #5: Ambiguity“Ambiguity” questions are easy to identify because the question will present two opposing or conflicting ideas.Give me an example of when you had to make an important decision and had to decide between moving forward or gathering more information.What did you do? What was the outcome? What information is necessary for you to have before acting?Give me an example of a calculated risk that you have taken where speed was critical.What was the situation and how did you handle it ? What steps did you take to mitigate the risk?Tell me a time you made a hard decision to sacrifice the short term gain for a longer term goal.All credit for this video goes to the legend Bruce Lee, and also to AMC who shot the original footage.CreditsCreator and Contributing AuthorKevin LanducciCore ConsultantsAline LernerSam JordanDivy GandhiEditorMax BoydSpecial thanksEvery one of our users who gave me feedback on the beta version, and all of the wonderful interviewers whom I'm not allowed to name 🙃We know exactly what to do and say to get the company, title, and salary you want.Interview prep and job hunting are chaos and pain.

Or you watched a YouTube video that made system design seem like an overwhelming topic you’ll never fully grasp. Or perhaps you have years of experience working in the field, yet you struggle to demonstrate your technical prowess in the brief span of a system design interview.Professional experience with distributed systems isn’t needed to pass system design interviews. And even if you do have that experience, keep in mind that many talented distributed systems engineers still struggle with the system design interview format. How you perform in an interview is not a measure of your worth as a software engineer—it is a measure of your ability to do system design interviews. The two are related but not equal; being a good programmer has a surprisingly small role in passing interviews.AnecdoteOne of our experts was asked: “As an experienced engineer without any scalable systems experience, how can I go into something like a FAANG system design interview when I have never designed those systems before?” Here’s the expert’s reply:\"I worked at Facebook for five and a half years. I learned more about system design from reading the internal interviewing wiki than I ever got from working at Facebook. They've got all kinds of distributed systems knowledge there, and it’s concentrated in a handful of infrastructure teams who build really great libraries and really great backend systems. That means that the rest of us never have to think about distributed systems. We get to say, 'I'm gonna make a new data type, and if I dump a billion records in it tomorrow, it doesn't matter. The systems folks have my back.' I worked at Facebook for a really long time, but I learned almost nothing about designing systems from experience.\"RememberYou can pass system design interviews even if you’ve never designed distributed systems before. If you have copied files between machines with drag-and-drop, you are halfway there. If you implemented clients or servers or have opened network connections, you’ve got this. This guide will teach you the most important 20% of information that will appear 80% of the time in system design interviews. By the end of this guide you won’t be an expert, but you’ll be well on your way to being a better engineer and a much better interview candidate.Want to know exactly what a FAANG System Design interviewer looks for?

We bolded to emphasize the parts that are most important to note.“There’s a difference between design problems and engineering problems... Engineering is a good approach to solving a problem when you can get a great deal of data and you’re sure there is one best solution. Bill \\[one of the authors\\] worked on the problem of engineering the hinges on Apple’s first laptops, and the solution he and his team came up with made those laptops some of the most reliable on the market. The solution required many prototypes and lots and lots of testing, similar to the design process, but the goal of creating hinges that would last five years (or opening and closing ten thousand times) was fixed, and his team tested many different mechanical solutions until they met their goal. Once this goal was met, the solution could be reproduced millions of times. It was a good engineering problem.“Compare this with the problem of designing the first laptop that had a ‘built in mouse’. Because Apple’s computers relied on the mouse to do almost everything, building a laptop that required you to be wired up to a regular mouse was unacceptable. This was a design problem. There was no precedent to design toward, there was no fixed or predetermined outcome; there were plenty of ideas floating around the lab, and a number of different designs were tested, but nothing was working. Then along came an engineer named Jon Krakower. Jon had been tinkering around with miniaturized trackballs, and had the crazy idea to push the keyboard to the back of the unit, leaving just enough room to squeeze in this tiny pointing device. This turned out to be the big breakthrough everyone had been looking for, and has been part of the signature look of Apple laptops ever since.“When you have a desired outcome (a truly portable laptop computer) but no clear solution in sight, that’s when you brainstorm, try crazy stuff, improvise, and keep ‘building your way forward’ until you come up with something that works. You know it when you see it. A great design comes together in a way that can’t be solved with equations and spreadsheets and data analysis. It has a look and feel all of its own - a beautiful aesthetic that speaks to you.”This is one reason engineers new to system design can bomb their first couple of system design interviews spectacularly: They approach a design problem as if it’s an engineering problem. There is not a single “best” solution to a system design problem. There are no predetermined outcomes. The less code you write in a system design interview, the better.To succeed in a system design interview, you want to collaborate with your interviewer, try crazy stuff, and try more crazy stuff until the design “feels right.”How approaching a system design interview is different than a coding interviewThe difference between coding and system design is the difference between retrieving and creating.Instead of finding (or “retrieving”) a solution, you are creating a solution. In this way, coding is akin to a science, while system design is more like an art.Here’s another way to think about it. You aren’t solving a problem—you’re creating a map to help someone else find the solution. Instead of coloring inside some lines, you’ll need to draw the lines for someone else to color in. In a system design interview, there are no correct answers—though there are certainly incorrect ones—so there is nothing to solve. Instead, you’ll ask questions, make stuff, and explain how and why the stuff you made was reasonable.Don’t think like a coder. Think like a Tech Lead.During the interview, you’ll spend an hour playing the role of a Tech Lead, so just pretend that the interviewer is a junior engineer who will be implementing your design. Juniors will have lots of questions, and since you’re the Tech Lead, you want to welcome these questions.Anecdote“Pretend it’s 1999, so a lot of the stuff we have access to today simply doesn’t exist. You and a group of your schoolmates are in your garage, hoping to make something. You're the most senior one there. You will design it and your friends will code it up, and the thing is: the Minimum Viable Product has to be completed by tomorrow. So, there’s no time to prep and no need to worry about the intricacies of system architecture that you don’t know. Just answer this: How would you design this system so your friends could code it up today, right now? It doesn’t have to be pretty. It doesn’t have to be complicated. It doesn’t have to impress anyone. It just has to get done.”What you do is important, but how you communicate is even more important.The value of communication in coding interviews is controversial (source). But without communication in a system design interview, nothing happens. By necessity, it’s more conversational in nature than a coding interview and will have more back and forth between interviewer and candidate.With that said, sometimes you’ll have an interviewer who is cold or not very collaborative. Dealing with these interviewers requires practice. The more senior you become, the more important it is to learn how to adjust your communication style to match your audience. We recommend completing mock interviews with a variety of interviewers to help you become a seasoned, fearless veteran of system design interviews.There are no optimal solutions in system design interviews.There’s no “right” way to design a system. If two experts designed the same system, you would see two different designs, beautiful and aesthetic in their own way and both as “correct” as the other (and with the accompanying justifications to support them).TipIn part 2, two experts will show you how they would each design the same system, providing you with a practical lesson on this topic.Lean towards your strengths.Anecdote“If you want to be a great interview candidate you’ve gotta know… It’s your responsibility to leave breadcrumbs for the interviewer to go where you want them to go. That way you have them walk you down the road where you are at your best. And then the Jedi mind trick is to get them to think it was their idea to get you there.”What if your measurement of success in an interview isn’t what you say, but instead it’s what you get the interviewer to say? Imagine you say something that engages the interviewer’s curiosity so much that they have no choice but to follow up with a “tell me more about that.” If the areas you get them to dig into the deepest, are things you’re good at: congratulations you are doing the Jedi mind trick.A candidate doing a system design interview will usually experience confusion. The interview format is so open-ended, you cannot know about everything they'll ask you. However, there will be opportunities to strut your stuff. There will be moments when they ask you about something you know very well, and when this happens put your shoulders back and flex your muscles on this topic.What it’s like to walk into a system design interviewWhen beginning an interview, try to imagine what the interviewer is looking for. What are their goals for the session? How can you help them achieve those goals in a way that persuades them that you’ll be a strong hire?Put simply, the interviewer's goal is to find enough data to hire you. Given the limited time available to them, an interviewer has to try to get enough positive signal about your ability so they can justify giving you a “hire” rating. In one hour you have to show your interviewer that you understand the fundamentals of a system (end to end). You also should be able to name and explain (at least at a high level) each part of the system, describe the tradeoffs you make, and find a solution.RememberThe best way to accomplish this is to imagine that you’re explaining a design doc to a group of more junior engineers. They will ask you questions about your decisions and want to know what you’re trying to solve. Anticipating these questions and your responses will set you up for success in the interview.Want to know exactly what a FAANG System Design interviewer looks for? Get detailed feedback on your system design skills from our professional interviewers.See available timesWhat your interviewer looks for, and what they don'tWith this basic model in mind, let's consider the main elements that system design interviewers look for, and the elements that don’t matter.What your interviewer wants to seea broad, base-level understanding of system design fundamentals.back-and-forth about problem constraints and parameters.well-reasoned, qualified decisions based on engineering trade-offs.the unique direction your experience and decisions take them.a holistic view of a system and its users.What your interviewer is not looking fordeep expertise in the given problem domain.assumptions about the prompt.specific answers with ironclad certainty.a predefined path from the beginning to end of the problem.strictly technical considerations.You do not need to display deep expertise in the given problem domain. Interviewers want to see that you have a broad, base-level understanding of system design fundamentals.Your interviewer will expect you to have knowledge of a wide range of basic topics, but they won't expect you to be an expert in any of them. For instance, you should understand the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, their broad performance characteristics, and the types of applications each might be useful for (which we’ll teach you later in this guide). But you would not need to know how the internals of either type of database work at any kind of detailed level.In spite of this, you still might be asked to design those internals! Keep in mind, though, that your answer doesn't need to be optimal or reflect real-world implementations. For example, if an interviewer asks you to design a database/SQL query engine, they're not trying to discern if you're familiar with the academic literature on query engines or discover how much time you've spent working on database internals.Instead, they want to see how you would approach the problem based on what you do know, starting from first principles and collaborating with them. Your answer will probably not be anywhere near optimal, and that's OK! The interviewer will focus on the process, not the result.Interviewers want to engage you in a back-and-forth conversation about problem constraints and parameters, so avoid making assumptions about the prompt.Initial prompts to system design problems tend to be intentionally light on detail. Many candidates make a mistake by extrapolating details from the initial prompt and crafting a solution based on those assumptions.For example, imagine that the interviewer instructs you to design a \"photo sharing service\" with some minimally defined capabilities. This may cause some candidates to imagine that they're rebuilding Instagram and start designing around the assumption that all images will be relatively small, not examined closely, and that extensive compression to save storage and bandwidth is acceptable.But the interviewer didn’t tell you to rebuild Instagram, so you’ll need to keep in mind that there are many different types of photo sharing services. The interviewer may have had in mind something like Imgur or Photobucket, sites that cater more to basic image hosting for the web. Or they could be thinking about something like Flickr or 500px, services built for photographers to show off their work in high resolution.So how do you figure out what type of service the interviewer wants you to build? Ask them! A basic prompt leaves room for you to start a conversation with your interviewer about the system you're designing—what type of users does it serve, what type of traffic can it expect, what limits will it have? Demonstrating that you can think critically about the parameters of your service is the first step in any system design interview.Interviewers are not looking for specific answers with ironclad certainty. They want to see well-reasoned, qualified decisions based on engineering trade-offs.Be very careful any time you find yourself responding immediately to a prompt in a system design interview. Even aspects of your design that seem insignificant need at least cursory consideration. Let’s use IDs as an example.A candidate will often start a discussion of a data model with a statement like, \"I'll use auto incrementing IDs,\" or \"I'll use GUID here\" as kind of a default approach to assigning IDs to data. In many applications, however, the type of ID you assign to your data has practical consequences.Is this ID going to be exposed to users? If so, how long does it need to be to avoid collisions? If we auto-increment it, are we worried about the visibility that will give third parties into our traffic patterns or the possibilities of users guessing the IDs to each others' data? If it's intended to be shared, is it convenient to type? If you print it on a business card or a flier, does it contain characters that you could confuse for each other (e.g., “1” and “I”, “0” and “O”)?You don't need to hold an inquiry for every minor detail, but always be sure to give some justification for the decisions you make and let your interviewer know how your decisions would change in different circumstances. System design problems don't have a single definitive answer, so interviewers just want to see that you can justify your answers.Interviewers are not looking for a predefined path from the beginning to end of the problem. They want to see the unique direction your experience and decisions take them.Coding problems usually have an expected path. Typically you'll begin with an obvious but inefficient solution, and then the interviewer will prompt you for a series of improvements. Those improvements lead you to increasingly efficient solutions until you finally arrive at the optimal implementation.System design problems, on the other hand, resemble a Choose Your Own Adventure book rather than a linear novel. A complex system contains a multitude of sub-components, each one of which could serve as a design problem on its own. After you've sketched the overall layout of your system, an interviewer may decide to keep your focus on the big picture or dive into a deeper examination of one particular component.The path your interview takes will be steered by your interviewer, but they're likely to take cues from the sub-problems in which you display interest or aptitude. In some cases they may explicitly ask you which part of the problem you'd prefer to focus on.Even if you're not choosing directly, you can still influence an interview's direction. As you talk your way through a solution, it’s OK to specifically note the parts that you have experience in and explain when you're making educated guesses. Your interviewer won't expect you to know everything, but giving them a better idea of what you do know will help them steer the interview in ways that reveal your strengths and problem-solving ability.Interviewers seek a holistic view of a system and its users.When faced with a choice in a design interview, it's easy to focus on the technical details, but remember that computer systems serve human users, so you’ll want to anchor your technical decisions to the user experience they enable.Suppose, for instance, that the image sharing service you're designing will require users to log in before uploading an image. In technical terms, you might want to avoid login to keep the database schema simpler, or you could introduce login to gather better metrics. An anonymous experience may be best for a public image-hosting site intended for quick turnaround and low interaction, while a logged-in experience offers the possibility of community features like commenting and sharing, personalized metrics, and the ability to restrict an upload to authorized viewers. You may want to take either approach or even both, allowing a limited anonymous experience with extra features for logged-in users.The important thing is to discuss the possible approaches and their consequences for the user experience with your interviewer before making a decision. You can never go wrong by making the end user the driving force in your design.Green Flags, Red Flags, and other signpostsThink of red and green flags as signposts you can use to orient yourself in the interview. Green flags indicate that things are going well, that you're engaging with the interviewer and making a positive impression. Red flags warn you that you may be going astray and should try to get the interview back on track.Red Flag #1: You believe that to pass a system design interview, you should just “play the game, keep talking, and make sure nobody explodes.”Following this quote’s advice has steered many interviewees in the wrong direction. There is no game, and talking for the sake of talking is one way to hang yourself with the rope the interviewer gives you. Also, if the goal is to not explode, well, you’re wasting your and your interviewer’s time.Green Flag #1: You communicate honestly about what you know and what you don’t.As we mentioned earlier, this guide will teach you the basic information that you’ll be asked about in 80% of system design interviews. Although these are great odds, you still may encounter a scenario that’s beyond your level of understanding. If this happens to you, don’t worry! Just engage in an honest dialogue with your interviewer, explaining when you lack certain knowledge or have gaps in your understanding. When you do have a sense of how to proceed, but you’re uncertain, you should communicate from first principles. Later in this guide, we will explain how to overcome that uncertainty and still score points with your interviewer.Red Flag #2: You find yourself pushing against interviewer feedback.Keep in mind that your interviewers use the same problems over and over again, and they frequently see candidates make the same mistakes. If they try to divert you from a course of action, it's likely because they've seen others flounder when using the same approach. You may be the one candidate in a hundred who finds a unique and better solution—we've had this happen before!—but carefully consider the odds before proceeding with a solution against the interviewer's advice.With that said, there is an art to pushing back against your interviewer when the situation calls for it, and later in this guide we’ll teach you how and when to employ this strategy .Green Flag #2: The interview feels like a collaboration between you and the interviewer.When the interviewer offers feedback, you integrate it into your design. You ask probing questions and receive useful answers about the system you're designing, its users, and its traffic. Try to establish a tone as if you were working through a problem with a coworker rather than proving yourself to an interviewer. In the real world, when you’re assigned a project, you’ll have to ask a variety of people several questions to ensure that you fully understand the problem before making decisions. That’s what interviewers want to see.Red Flag #3: You skip over questions and ignore interviewer prompts, trying to move the interview ahead without addressing their concerns.It's OK to not know things—no one will have every answer—but it's better to admit that to your interviewer than to avoid the questions altogether. Your interviewer may be able to offer you a hint or help you reason about alternatives if they know you're struggling, but if you skip right ahead you'll miss the opportunity to provide them with any positive signal from that portion.Green Flag #3: Your role determines who should drive the focus and pace of the interview.If you’re looking for a mid-level position or below, your interviewer should determine the direction and speed of the interview. Given an initial overview of your design, they may ask you for clarification on some aspects of it. They may ask you to produce a more detailed design for one or more components. And they may also change the requirements and ask how you could adapt your solution to accommodate this new view of the world. Wherever they take the interview, follow along and focus on the areas they direct you to.If you’re applying for a senior role (or above), it’s a good sign if you direct more of the interview. In junior system design interviews, the interviewer expects to drive the interview, but as you reach senior levels the expectation shifts to the interviewee.Anecdote from a seasoned interviewer​​Being overly confident and talking too much might count against a mid-level candidate. Some interviewers (especially off-script ones) love giving candidates more rope to hang themselves with, and then they ask specific questions that focus on what the candidate struggles with.If your goal is to maximize a mid-level offer, not improve your \"average passing rate\" (i.e., if you are comfortable sacrificing some senior-plus chances to increase your mid-level chances), then you might be better off consciously \"giving control away\" to your interviewer.Simply put, at the above-senior level an awkward pause will be held against you—that’s basically guaranteed. But at mid-level, most of your attempts to fill in an awkward pause may hurt you more than keeping silent.Another way to think of it: when you are not leading the conversation, you signal that you’re not really far above mid-level. (But if you are comfortable at mid-level, this is not a downside!)The saying, ‘Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt’ can be true for mid-level interviews but not for seniors or above-senior.”Red Flag #4: You leave long stretches (several minutes) of silence multiple times throughout the interview.If you're struggling to provide an answer, give yourself a little bit of time to come up with something. If you're truly stuck, however, you should ask your interviewer for help. They can't tell that you're at an impasse unless you tell them, and you may waste valuable interview time while they debate whether it's been long enough to interrupt you.Green Flag #4: You take time to collect your thoughts and refine solutions before offering them up out loud/on the board.An interview doesn't need to be a continuous stream of consciousness, and it never hurts to sanity check your ideas before verbalizing them.TipIn Part 4 of this guide, we’ll teach you how to get unstuck and exactly what to say when you’re stuck.A few more signpostsA common failure point occurs when candidates don’t make decisionsOften, candidates will say things like: “we could use this type of DB, or this other, or that other, and these are some pros and cons…” and then they move on to another component. It’s a good practice to talk about benefits and tradeoffs, but then you have to make a decision. In the real world you have to make decisions—the same thing applies to the interview. If the interviewer challenges you with some questions, it’s totally fine to change your mind and alter the component (if you think there are better choices).Don’t sayWe could use this type of DB, or this other, or that other, and these are some pros and cons…Do say\"We could use this type of DB, or this other, or that other, and these are some pros and cons… And based on all these tradeoffs, I’ll use THAT type of DB.\"Interviewers want to identify “impostors”: people who just learned a few words and try to pass the interview.Don’t say things because you think you’re supposed to say them. This often occurs when candidates name specific brands of technologies (e.g., “Kafka” or “Cassandra”). Not being familiar with specific databases or other components is fine. Be smart and don’t say brand names just for the sake of saying them.Don’t sayI’m going to use Cassandra...” unless you are VERY familiar with that, because the next question will be: “Why Cassandra and not some\\_other\\_db?Do sayI’m going to use a NoSQL db because of \\[insert brief rationale\\].Don’t sayI will use Kafka…” unless you’re prepared to explain how Kafka works. Don’t say “I will use Kafka” unless you are prepared to talk about other types of queues, because they may ask you: “Oh, Kafka, interesting choice. Why that instead of \\[some other queue\\]?Do sayI will use a queue because of \\[insert brief rationale\\].RememberSay the generic name of the component, not the brand name unless you are very familiar with it. Don’t say Kafka. Instead, say “a queue.You finished Part 1! We hope you gained a basic understanding of the system design interview and learned some tips and tricks you can use to excel in it. As you continue reading Parts 2-4, these “glimmers” of understanding will become more and more the default system of your interviewing skills.In Part 2 we’ll teach you the 15 fundamental system design concepts. You’ll also get to watch our long form video of two system design experts designing the same system. They’re tasked with designing interviewing.io, which in this challenge is actually three systems in one: “Design google docs, a remote compiler, and a recording service… in 30 minutes or less.”Part 2: 15 fundamental system...CreditsCreator and authorKevin LanducciContributing authorsAyush BaglaMartin CopesDima KorolevFrank (Haolun) LiMichael MroczkaCore consultantsBruno AlbuquerqueAdam BhulaGrace SheaTechnical reviewerGithire (Brian) WahomeAdditional consultantsBret FunkKyle PaciaJosh ThompsonEditorAline LernerSpecial thanksAll of the wonderful interviewers whom we’re not allowed to name 🙃We know exactly what to do and say to get the company, title, and salary you want.Interview prep and job hunting are chaos and pain.

This one is the most thorough and the most detailed because it’s the only one made by interviewers for candidates – we spent hundreds of hours talking to dozens of current and former FAANG interviewers about their processes. Throughout this guide, you’ll see a bunch of direct quotes from these interviewers, where they describe the idiosyncrasies of each company’s process and bar in their own words. We’re fortunate to have them in the interviewing.io community, and we’re lucky that we can collaborate with them on this type of content. As you can imagine, they all requested to stay anonymous, but we want to thank them here, first and foremost.Introduction to FAANG interviewsFAANG interviews are a gauntlet, but you can pass them even if you doubt yourself – interviewing is easier once you learn a company’s operating metaphor. George Lakoff (neuroscience and artificial Intelligence researcher) says that every human organization has a metaphor they operate as. If you ask an employee at a FAANG company about their metaphor, you’ll probably receive a blank stare in return. But if you look at the interviewing data of that same FAANG company, the metaphors jump out of the data set like bread out of a toaster. This guide will walk you through all the FAANGs’ metaphors and the unwritten codes of those metaphors: what they reward, what they punish, and what they’re blind to. To show them you’re obviously a part of their tribe, model their metaphors and unwritten codes.Metaphors aside, this guide will also walk you through the unglamorous logistics of every FAANG’s interview process so that you know how many steps there are, what those steps entail, and what kinds of questions they ask. Our goal is to have you walk in and be completely unfazed by the proceedings because you’re expecting them.Of course, even with all the insider info in the world, if you’re not prepared for technical interviews, you will fail, so we’d be remiss if we didn’t share some useful insights about practice to help you on your journey.About this guideThere are 3 steps to getting a strong offer at FAANG.Step 1: Get Interview.Step 2: Do Interview.Step 3: Negotiate.Steps 1 and 3 are out of scope for this post, which is solely focused on Step 2.Moreover, this guide is written for experienced, back-end leaning engineers – interview processes are usually different for juniors, but we won’t be getting into those differences. Finally, we won’t be getting into the differences in process for front-end engineers, SREs, etc. That said, if you’re targeting those roles, you’ll still get value out of this guide.In Part 1 of this guide, we’ll highlight key similarities and differences between the FAANG companies, namely:MetaAppleAmazonNetflixGoogleMicrosoft (they’re not officially FAANG, but we’re including them anyway – from now on, when we say “FAANG”, we mean Microsoft as well)In Part 2, we’ll go through each company one by one and tell you how each of their processes work and how to prepare for each one.If you’re planning on interviewing with multiple FAANGS, we recommend reading Part 1 first. If you'd prefer to skip straight to a company’s individual guide then just click on it in the table of contents to the left! Individual guides include more detailed information on company-specific coding interviews, behavioral interviews, and anecdotes from actual interview experiences.All of these big tech companies share grueling interview processes, strong initial compensation packages, and above average benefits. They compete with each other for the same engineers. If tech has a food chain, they’re at the top. Most other tech companies copy or are influenced by what FAANG does.There are also a number of myths about FAANG interview processes. Two big ones are that Amazon has the lowest bar, and Google has the highest bar. That’s not true; we have the data. The reality is that all of their bars are different. It’s not a linear comparison. It’s a multidimensional comparison. Because of that, it’s impossible to say something like, “The entire process at Google is harder than the entire process at Amazon.” They’re simply different processes.Anecdote from a Facebook Interviewer“My friend interviewed at Google and Facebook, and he passed both loops. At Google, he was offered L6. At Facebook, he was offered L4. Speaking about luck: this is the same person with the same experience. And the level of difference– at two of the most trusted names in tech–was two levels of seniority.And one common idea in big tech is that Google’s process is easier than Facebook’s. But you can see here: it really depends. After all, this person accepted the L4 role at Facebook because the compensation package was bigger than the role at Google for L6.”Long story short: it’s complicated. That’s exactly why we wrote this guide: to demystify the differences, to decouple the 6-headed monster, and to demonstrate how to attack each head, one at a time.3 tips for FAANG interview successThis is the ultimate insider’s guide to tech interviews at FAANG. However, even with all the insider info in the world, if you’re not prepared for technical interviews, you will fail, so we’d be remiss if we didn’t share some useful insights about practice to help you on your journey. Yes, we know we’re a practice platform, and, look, you don’t have to practice with us. But you should practice! Here’s why.1. Do five practice interviewsThree different startups with robust data sets on software engineering interviews found eerily similar data points about what happens after you do five technical interviews. I worked at all three companies and saw this data myself. In a previous article about how to know when you're ready to interview at FAANG we shared that completing 5 technical interviews (mock interviews or real) doubles your chances of passing a subsequent technical interview.Triplebyte found that the chances of getting at least 1 offer increases with each onsite you do, up until 5 onsites. For each onsite completed after the 5th, your chances of getting an offer level off at 80-85%. Pathrise found that most of their engineers failed 4-5 onsites before they got an offer. Mind you, these datasets were quite different: Triplebyte skewed towards folks with nontraditional backgrounds, interviewing.io inclined towards senior backend engineers, and Pathrise was mainly junior engineers. Despite that, the number five emerged across these data sets, and it’s clear that something happens after you complete five technical interviews. We can’t explain what yet. But the data is screaming in all caps: there is a there there. One more anecdotal point: these five interviews should ideally mimic the real thing as much as possible. For instance, if you want a FAANG job, but your five interviews are with startups that don’t ask algorithmic questions, you won’t get as much value. The more your practice can simulate the real game, the better.2. If you’re unprepared, it’s OK to rescheduleIf you’re unprepared for a FAANG interview, ask to reschedule. Not rescheduling is the number one mistake we see our users make! Getting an interview tomorrow (as opposed to 1-3 months from tomorrow) is, in most cases, no different to the company… but very different to you – if you fail, you might get frozen out for months. In the rare cases where rescheduling could hurt your chances because it’s a specific role for a specific team, your recruiter will tell you that. Either way, there’s no harm in asking.3. A note about recruiter callsRecruiter calls don’t differ much from FAANG company to FAANG company, so we decided to put everything about what to expect in a recruiter call in one place. If a recruiter call ever meaningfully deviates from this format, we’ll mention it. Otherwise, expect that it doesn’t.A recruiter call is the first step of almost every process. In this call, a recruiter will ask you about your past experience, your salary expectations, and why you’re interested in that particular company. They will also ask you about your timeline (how soon you expect to accept an offer), how far along you are with other companies, whether you have outstanding offers, and so on.In this call, it’s important to be able to succinctly talk about your past few positions, your major contributions at those positions (what did you do individually versus what did your team do) and their impact on the business. Remember that most recruiters don’t have a technical background and they’re not software developers, so it’s important to be able to describe your technical contributions in clear layman’s terms.It’s also really important, at this stage, not to reveal your salary expectations, your salary history, or where you are in the process with other companies. We wrote a detailed post about salary negotiation that lays out exactly what to say when recruiters pressure you to name the first number. Just don’t do it – when you give out information this early in the process, you’re painting future you into a corner.Part 1. Differences between the FAANGsThe Chaos ScoreThis section will give you a feel for how these companies’ processes differ. For now, don’t worry about how that translates into interview prep – we’ll cover that later when we describe how to prepare for each company.Take a look at the chart below. In it, we rank the FAANGs on their “Chaos Score”. The more points a company has, the more chaotic they are.In this context, we define “chaos” as the level of uncertainty and unpredictability that candidates can expect from the interview process and its outcomes. If a company consistently follows the same process, asks the same questions, and thoroughly trains their interviewers, they are not chaotic. If their process is completely non-standard, non-deterministic and subjective, they are chaotic.Company NameChaos ScoreApple20Netflix20Microsoft18Amazon12Google10Meta3As you can see, Apple and Netflix win the award for the most chaotic interview processes in FAANG. Microsoft gets 2nd place. Amazon gets 3rd, Google 4th, and Facebook 5th. Chaos can be pain or pleasure depending on your tolerance for uncertainty. Chaos can also either impose a terrible detriment or prove a huge advantage in interviews specifically. For instance, candidates who have spent a long time grinding on LeetCode might prefer less chaotic companies. More chaotic companies can work for candidates for a few reasons: a) niche skill sets can be an easier match for niche interview processes, b) practical interviews are more likely, and c) the interview process shows them how the team they’d be joining actually operates. How we calculated the Chaos Score for each companyTo calculate each company’s Chaos Score, we picked four categories and graded each company on a 0 to 5 point scale in each category, where 5 means most chaotic and 0 means least. The “north star” of their decision-making process (do they care more about “What”, “Why”, or “How”?)If they have the same interviews company-wide or if the interview changes depending on the team with which you’re interviewingHow much they train their interviewersHow much they standardize their interview questions We added up the points for each company, with a maximum possible Chaos Score of 20.Deep dive into the FAANG Chaos ScoresNorth starTeam dependent process?Level of training for interviewers?Level of standardization?AppleWhy (5)Yes (5)None (5)None (5)NetflixWhy (5)Yes (5)None (5)None (5)MicrosoftHow (3)Yes (5)None (5)None (5)AmazonWhat (1)Yes (5)High (2)Low (4)GoogleHow (3)No (0)Medium (3)Low (4)FacebookWhat (1)No (0)Highest (1)Highest (1)The more points a company has for each category, the more chaotic they are.The north star: “What”, “Why”, and “How” companiesBy “North star”, we mean what a given company values most. As such, we grouped companies into 3 buckets: companies who primarily care about \"Why\", \"How\", and \"What\".“Why” is the most chaotic because judging motivations is the most subjective approach. “How” is the second most chaotic because judging thought processes is the second most subjective. “What” is the least chaotic because judging end results is the least subjective method.“Why” companies can’t agree on what a good “why” looks like because it’s a “gut feel / friend test”. Whom you consider to be a friend and who gives you a good gut feeling isn’t quantifiable. It’s completely subjective. “Why” companies are the most prone to bias. If you speak their language and model the behaviors they encourage, you’ll seem like a friend and give them a good gut feel. If you don’t, then you won’t.If chaos is hell, then “Why” companies are raising hell for candidates and themselves. “How” companies mainly care about your thought process: Okay, you didn’t get to the optimal solution, but what was the journey like? Google and Microsoft repeat this mantra again and again – they want to know how you think. You might get asked a really hard or specific question, but they don’t necessarily require an optimal answer to pass. They put far more weight on your ability to demonstrate a solid thought process. “What” companies mainly care about your results, such as: Did you get to the optimal solution? Facebook and Amazon want you to get there, and fast. “What” is the most straightforward for candidates: simply get results as quickly as possible. Team-dependent processA Google or Facebook interview doesn’t change depending on the team you’re interviewing for. Both companies have one big, centralized interview process that’s completely divorced from which team you might end up on. If you do well in the team-agnostic process, there will be a team matching component after the onsite. You will NOT, however, be interviewing with your future coworkers. (Note: Google is rumored to be changing to a team-dependent process, but we’ll leave that where it is for now.)At Microsoft, Netflix, Apple, and Amazon, the process is team-dependent. You’ll not only be interviewing with the people that you’ll be working with, but there’s more chaos. Each team defines how they do things: the types of questions asked, the types of interview rounds, and even how they make hiring decisions. Team-dependent processes are more challenging in the sense that you're more likely to get blind-sided; because each team has a different process, candidates are more likely to prep for X and get (a significantly different) Y. Yet, team-independent processes are more challenging because of the machinery. Your interviewers are so far removed from you. That detachment affects how they treat, judge, and talk about you. Think of it like this: At Netflix, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft you’re interviewing with humans. At Google and Facebook, you’re interviewing with a machine.Interviewer trainingFacebook is the least chaotic company in this category because they have the most in-depth interviewer training in FAANG. Their process is rigorous and selective. Though most would-be interviewers pass within 6 months, some people who try never pass the bar to become an interviewer. Facebook is the only FAANG where this is true.Facebook and Amazon put interviewer candidates through roughly the same things, but Facebook is more rigorous. For example, both will have similar modules interviewers go through in training. A module at Amazon is more likely to be a box to check: if you do it, you pass. At Facebook, you don’t pass simply for doing it: you pass by meeting a predetermined bar. Also, Facebook modules are more likely to have a rubric. Google used to have a more in-depth interviewer training process than what they have now. For whatever reason, they began to skimp on their interviewer training roughly sometime in the 2010s. Now, Googlers can get a bit of training, but usually not as much as folks at Facebook or Amazon. Netflix, Microsoft, and Apple do not train their interviewers; certain teams may be exceptions but there’s no company-wide required interview training. The day you start, you can start interviewing. That makes them the most chaotic in this category. What this means for candidates is that the less training they put their interviewers through, the more likely you’ll have a bad interviewer. As the old saying goes: “Prepare for the worst, pray for the best.”Interview question standardizationCompanies that standardize their interview questions give interviewers less free reign; groups with no standardization have more free reign. At all companies, there will be interviewers who go rogue and deviate from the norm. Yet, each company has a norm. Facebook wins again for being the least chaotic/most predictable. In behavioral rounds, interviewers at Facebook can ask whatever behavioral questions they want. However, in technical rounds, they can only ask pre-approved coding questions. They can also modify pre-approved coding challenges. That’s it. Google is tied for the second least chaotic here; their interviewers have free reign in technical rounds. They have a large technical question bank, yet interviewers routinely make up their own ambiguous one-of-a-kind questions. In behavioral rounds, they can only ask or modify pre-approved questions.Amazon is tied for second least chaotic, but for a different reason. Technically, there’s no standardization for any round (technical or behavioral). They do, however, tend to repeat questions from their internal question bank (which is not required for interviewers to use.) Microsoft, Apple, and Netflix are the most chaotic companies. Each team decides what to ask. Questions tend to be customized to the hiring manager’s preferences, a senior individual contributor’s diligence, what this team works on day-to-day, or the specific domain this team is in. Which FAANGs let you interview with different teams simultaneously?Whether you get one shot or unlimited shots to land an offer changes how you prepare. Here’s the breakdown of which companies let you interview with multiple teams concurrently.Company NameCan interview with different teams concurrently?AppleYesNetflixYesMicrosoftYesAmazonYesGoogleNoMetaNoIf you can interview with multiple teams concurrently, then they don’t have a cool down period. So, after you fail, you don’t need to wait at all to reinterview. Two of the biggest players only give you one shot to win, and at the remaining four your chances are unlimited. Because their interview process is centralized, Google and Facebook are the only ones well-organized enough to not let candidates “double dip”. Tip to get unstuckIf you really want a job at Netflix, Apple, Amazon, or Microsoft: stack the odds of landing your dream job in your favor and interview with multiple teams. There’s no cool-down period, so if you get rejected from Team A, you can interview with Team B tomorrow.
