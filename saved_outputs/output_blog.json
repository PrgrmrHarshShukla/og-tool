It’s a classic, and the main point is that good design should make everything painfully obvious to users without demanding anything of them. Resumes are just the same. Your resume shouldn’t make recruiters think. It should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less. Before I share some resume tips, there’s something important I want to reiterate: Don’t spend a lot of time on your resume. You can read my piece about how resume writing is snake oil, but the TL;DR is that recruiters spend a median of 30 seconds looking at resumes, and most of that is spent looking for top-tier companies. If you don’t have top-tier companies (and in some cases niche skills), wordsmithing your bullets or rearranging your sections or changing your layout won’t help. If you do have top-tier companies, sometimes doing some wordsmithing and rearrangement will help… if your top company experience or niche skills are buried. If you don’t have top-tier brands, the best bang for your buck is to switch from online applications to hiring manager outreach. Here’s how to do it. With that said, I know that no matter what I say, people will still grind on their resumes instead of doing outreach. Grinding on resumes is safe. Outreach is scary and opens you up to personal (rather than impersonal) rejection. So, look, if you’re going to do something to your resume, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Unlike the endless resume tweaking that most candidates do, these changes directly address how recruiters actually read resumes. Here we go. Stop putting filler buzzwords in your \"About\" section. Use it to spell out the most impressive things about you. Your \"About\" or \"Summary\" section is prime real estate. Yet so many candidates fill this section with meaningless jargon like \"passionate self-starter\" or \"detail-oriented team player.\" Instead, use this section to explicitly tell recruiters the 2-3 most impressive things about you in plain English. This is your chance to control the narrative. Want recruiters to take something away from reading your resume? Don’t assume they’ll figure it out. They’re not reading it long enough to intuit anything. Spell it out for them verbatim in this section. Do this, not that: ❌ Results-driven full-stack engineer with a passion for scalable systems and user-centric design ✅ Senior engineer with 3 years at Amazon, promoted twice in 3 years (2X the company average)1 Don’t include your GPA if it’s under 3.8 This is simple but effective: only include your GPA if it's 3.8 or higher2. A middling GPA doesn't help your case and might inadvertently signal academic mediocrity. If your GPA isn't stellar, focus on other academic achievements: hackathons, technical competitions, fellowships or scholarships. These provide better signals about your capabilities than a so-so GPA. Context matters for lesser-known companies If you've worked at Google or Facebook, recruiters instantly get what kind of company you're coming from. But when you have \"TechStartup123\" on your resume, they have no idea what they're looking at or how impressive it might be. For lesser-known companies, include a one-line description explaining what the company does, along with any impressive metrics or investors: ❌ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc.\" ✅ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc. ($50M Series B from Sequoia, 2M+ active users)\" This simple addition provides crucial context that helps recruiters evaluate your experience properly. Without it, they might discount valuable experience simply because they don't recognize the company name. Avoid the \"job-hopper\" misperception Here's a common mistake: listing each role at the same company as if they were separate jobs. This can make recruiters think you've job-hopped, which is often seen as a red flag. Instead, group different roles under the same company heading: ❌ Listing separate entries for \"Junior Developer at XYZ\" and \"Senior Developer at XYZ\" ✅ \"XYZ Company - Senior Developer (2021-Present) - Junior Developer (2019-2021) Promoted in 2 years vs. company average of 3.5 years\" The second format clearly shows growth within a single company and explicitly highlights faster-than-average promotion, which is a strong positive signal. (You may also want to carry over your promotion cadence into your “About” section, as you saw above.) Be crystal clear about your work authorization status This one is particularly crucial if you have a foreign-sounding name and/or education outside the US. I've seen many qualified candidates get passed over because recruiters assumed they needed visa sponsorship when they actually didn't. Don't leave this to chance. Make your work status explicit in your header or summary section: ❌ No mention of work authorization (leaving recruiters to guess) ✅ \"US Citizen\" or \"Green Card Holder\" or \"Authorized to work in the US without visa sponsorship\" Career changers: provide context about the change If you've switched careers, your resume can look confusing without proper context. Recruiters might struggle to understand why someone with your background is applying for this role, or they might not recognize how your previous experience translates to your current trajectory. Address this head-on in your “About” section. ❌ Listing previous career experience with no explanation of your transition ✅ \"Transitioned from marketing to software engineering in 2021 after completing a bootcamp\" or \"Former accountant who pivoted to data science through self-study and online courses while continuing full-time work\" This context helps recruiters understand your timeline and puts your current title and achievements in perspective. Without it, you risk serious misinterpretation: Recruiters might think you're far more junior than you actually are in your new field (potentially ruling you out for appropriate-level positions) Or conversely, they might assume you have years of relevant experience in your new field (and then wonder why you haven't achieved more in that time) Both misinterpretations can be fatal to your application. By providing a clear timeline of your transition, you help recruiters accurately gauge your experience level and set appropriate expectations. This transparency also demonstrates valuable traits like adaptability and determination. And here's another key point for career changers: you don't need to list all your previous positions before the transition... unless they're impressive. Be selective about what pre-transition experience you include: ❌ DON'T include mundane or irrelevant details from your previous career that add nothing to your current narrative. Your three years as a retail associate before becoming a developer probably won't strengthen your software engineering application. ✅ DO highlight prestigious achievements from your previous career. If you were, say, a concert pianist, a lawyer who graduated from a top-tier law school, or a management consultant at McKinsey, absolutely include that. These signal that you're smart and high-achieving, regardless of domain. In conclusion If you do all these things, you may or may not see a return. After all, even the impact of these tweaks pales in comparison to having top brands on your resume. But, given that these will take you a few minutes to do, it doesn’t hurt.

          "content": "Footnotes Will side projects help you get a job? Good question and one that should be teased apart a bit. Getting a job has two components: getting in the door and doing well in interviews. In general, side projects are useless for getting in the door. Yes, every once in a while, a side project goes viral. Or if you build something really cool with your target company’s API, it can get some attention. But that’s pretty rare. Most side projects that adorn resumes go completely unnoticed. When it comes to performing well in interviews, it depends. If the companies you’re interviewing at test you on practical skills, then they can be a great use of time. They can also be a great use of time to help you understand how APIs work, how the internet works, how clients and servers talk to each other, and so on. But if the companies you’re targeting primarily ask algorithmic questions, then side projects probably aren’t the best use of time. Finally, will side projects make you a better engineer? Absolutely. And that’s the best reason to do them. But that’s not quite the same as getting a job, is it? Once you're actively looking for a job, your time is better spent on interview prep and outreach. ↩",

          "content": "Footnotes Yes, it’s true that in 2022, we saw several FAANGs and many other companies freeze hiring, and if you had postponed your interviews, you’d have been left out in the cold. Despite how devastating these freezes were to affected candidates (and to the tech economy as whole), they are extremely rare, and in our humble opinion, not worth optimizing for or worrying about. You are very unlikely to have to deal with an impending freeze. ↩ Some companies will also have technical deep dives, project presentations, assessments of niche skills, and so on. ↩",

It's fittingly called Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview.. Now, we're releasing 9 chapters of the book for free! There are two PDFs in the linked folder: The first seven chapters of the book, covering topics such as why technical interviews are broken, what recruiters won't tell you, why not to spend a lot of time on resumes, and how to get in the door at companies without a referral. Two technical chapters: Sliding Windows and Binary Search. Our new take on Binary Search teaches one template that works for every binary search problem on LeetCode, with only a single-line change you need to remember. The Sliding Windows chapter features 6 unique sliding window templates that make off-by-one errors a thing of the past. Take a look, and let me know what you think.

Read 9 chapters for free →interviewing.ioOpen menuInterview resourcesFor employersGift mock interviewsBlogFAQLog inGive it a tryBlog HomeWe co-wrote the official sequel to Cracking the Coding Interview!By Aline Lerner | Published: January 27, 2025; Last updated: April 28, 2025EDIT 2: Read 9 chapters of the book for free! These include: The first seven chapters of the book, covering topics such as why technical interviews are broken, what recruiters won't tell you, why not to spend a lot of time on resumes, and how to get in the door at companies without a referral. Two technical chapters: Sliding Windows and Binary Search. Our new take on Binary Search teaches one template that works for every binary search problem on LeetCode, with only a single-line change you need to remember. The Sliding Windows chapter features 6 unique sliding window templates that make off-by-one errors a thing of the past. EDIT: Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview is out now! Here's the table of contents: I have some exciting news. Along with Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Mike Mroczka, and Nil Mamano, I’m writing the official sequel to Cracking the Coding Interview (often called the bible of technical interview prep). It's fittingly called Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. I’ve always wanted to write a book about technical interviewing. And this is it. And of course it'll draw on all the hiring data we've collected over the past decade at interviewing.io. Technical interviews are much harder today than they used to be. Engineers study for months and routinely get down-leveled despite that. Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview, in addition to covering a bunch of new questions and topics, teaches you how to think instead of memorizing. Grinding and memorization isn’t the way in this market (though in fairness, it’s never really the way). With us, you’ll still have to do the work, of course, but we’ll teach you to work smarter. We added at least thirteen new technical topics (I say “at least” because we’re still writing, and it might be more like twenty)—and over 150 new problems. Each problem includes step-by-step walkthroughs, and you can work each problem with our (actually good) AI Interviewer. And of course this book was written in partnership with interviewing.io. We’ve pulled in data from over 100k FAANG mock interviews on interviewing.io, and we include hundreds of curated interview replays from interviewing.io (shared with permission of course) – watch people make mistakes and learn so you’re not doomed to repeat them. But it’s not just about interview prep. In today’s job market, the bar is higher but it’s also harder than ever to get noticed and run your job search end-to-end. My excellent co-authors killed it on the technical chapters. I focused on writing the job search stuff, including, but not limited to: How to negotiate, exactly what to say, and how to not screw up your negotiations before they even start How to manage your job search, end to end, and balance interview prep with applications and outreach A worksheet to help you figure out what order you need to engage with the companies you’re targeting to ensure that all your offers come in at the same time How to get in the door at top companies without relying on referrals, including email templates and examples of good and bad outreach An internal look at FAANG (and other) company rubrics to help understand what interviewers really care about, no matter what company you're applying to What you need to know about behavioral interviews, whether you want to or not, and how to avoid the mistakes that even great engineers make A list of very specific questions to ask your interviewers (not just to look smart but to learn useful things) How technical interviews got to be so broken and how to get over hating them so you can win I also spend some time on owning and sharing data on how flawed technical interviewing is and, most importantly, how to manage your psychology so you can get past that. I see so many engineers opting out of this interview style, arguably for good reason. But you’re leaving a lot of good opportunities on the table, and it doesn’t have to be like that. This book is so much of what I’ve blogged about for the last 15 years, but it’s fleshed out with much more detail and actionable advice. If you read it, let me know what you think. Technical interviewing sucks (and so does looking for a job). But this book will help you do it well and get out alive. Purchases of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview get a $50 discount for interviewing.io. The book costs $45, so it’s not a bad deal.

Along with Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Mike Mroczka, and Nil Mamano, I’m writing the official sequel to \\_Cracking the Coding Interview\\_ (often called the bible of technical interview prep). It's fittingly called \\[\\_Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview.\\_\\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X)\\\\n\\\\nI’ve always wanted to write a book about technical interviewing. And this is it. And of course it'll draw on all the hiring data we've collected over the past decade at interviewing.io.\\\\n\\\\nTechnical interviews are much harder today than they used to be. Engineers study for months and routinely get down-leveled despite that. \\[\\_Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview\\_\\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X), in addition to covering a bunch of new questions and topics, teaches you how to think instead of memorizing. Grinding and memorization isn’t the way in this market (though in fairness, it’s never really the way). With us, you’ll still have to do the work, of course, but we’ll teach you to work smarter.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X\\\\\"\\\\u003e\\\\u003cimg src=\\\\\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/book\\_cover\\_87f67665fd.png\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview book cover\\\\\" style=\\\\\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:300px;\\\\\"/\\\\u003e\\\\u003c/a\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\nWe added at least thirteen new technical topics (I say “at least” because we’re still writing, and it might be more like twenty)—and over 150 new problems. Each problem includes step-by-step walkthroughs, and you can work each problem with our (actually good) AI Interviewer. And of course this book was written in partnership with interviewing.io. We’ve pulled in data from over 100k FAANG mock interviews on interviewing.io, and we include hundreds of curated interview replays from interviewing.io (shared with permission of course) – watch people make mistakes and learn so you’re not doomed to repeat them.\\\\n\\\\nBut it’s not \\_just\\_ about interview prep. In today’s job market, the bar is higher but it’s also harder than ever to get noticed and run your job search end-to-end. My excellent co-authors killed it on the technical chapters. I focused on writing the job search stuff, including, but not limited to:\\\\n\\\\n\\* How to negotiate, exactly what to say, and how to not screw up your negotiations before they even start\\\\n\\* How to manage your job search, end to end, and balance interview prep with applications and outreach\\\\n\\* A worksheet to help you figure out what order you need to engage with the companies you’re targeting to ensure that all your offers come in at the same time\\\\n\\* How to get in the door at top companies without relying on referrals, including email templates and examples of good and bad outreach\\\\n\\* An internal look at FAANG (and other) company rubrics to help understand what interviewers really care about, no matter what company you're applying to\\\\n\\* What you need to know about behavioral interviews, whether you want to or not, and how to avoid the mistakes that even great engineers make\\\\n\\* A list of very specific questions to ask your interviewers (not just to look smart but to learn useful things)\\\\n\\* How technical interviews got to be so broken and how to get over hating them so you can win\\\\n\\\\nI also spend some time on owning and sharing data on how flawed technical interviewing is and, most importantly, how to manage your psychology so you can get past that. I see so many engineers opting out of this interview style, arguably for good reason. But you’re leaving a lot of good opportunities on the table, and it doesn’t have to be like that.\\\\n\\\\nThis book is so much of what I’ve blogged about for the last 15 years, but it’s fleshed out with much more detail and actionable advice. If you read it, let me know what you think. Technical interviewing sucks (and so does looking for a job). But this book will help you do it well and get out alive.\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Purchases of \\[\\_Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview\\_\\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/195570600X) get a $50 discount for interviewing.io. The book costs $45, so it’s not a bad deal.

          "content": "Footnotes In fairness, the Scale AI post positioned them as symbiotic. I believe that as well. ↩ There are many sources arguing for and against diversity leading to better-performing teams. Here are some examples: For: https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters Against: https://medium.com/the-liberators/in-depth-the-double-edged-sword-of-diversity-in-teams-765ff72a55da (except for “age diversity”) and https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/05/25/diversity-and-performance-in-entrepreneurial-teams/ ↩ One of the most insulting examples of the “we need a diverse workforce to serve our diverse customer base” argument occurred when I was pitching Amazon on using interviewing.io to hire. This was years ago, and back then, out of curiosity, I’d always ask the organizations we were pitching why they valued diversity. I don’t think I ever got a good answer, but this one was especially bad. One of the recruiters we met with went on a long diatribe about how Amazon sells lots of shoes and you need women on the eng team because women understand shoes better than men. ↩ Getting more women and people of color to study computer science is a worthy cause. Hell, getting anyone who’s historically been marginalized to study computer science is worthwhile. It’s great for our economy, and it’s currently one of the best levers for upward social mobility available. But, while we hope more companies do these things, it is not reasonable to expect that companies can be responsible for educational interventions that often need to start at the elementary school level. Of course, companies should do what they can. But expecting them to pull off mathematical impossibilities is irrational, and the DEI movement’s stalwart refusal to acknowledge the pipeline problem undermines the movement as a whole. ↩ I was actually able to get in touch with a former OFCCP higher-up who admitted that rejecting anonymity in hiring was against the spirit of OFCCP requirements. But they sadly wouldn’t go on the record. ↩ The closest we’ve ever come to doing this is our Fellowship program, where we gave free practice to engineers from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. It was a great program, but what made it great was that our interviewers were eager to help these candidates. We were able to do free practice because our interviewers graciously agreed not to charge. That said, if I were to run this program again, I’d probably focus more on socioeconomic status and non-traditional credentials rather than just race and gender. ↩ Here’s the email we ended the relationship with. I’m including it because it was hard to write and even harder to hit send on, but I think we did the right thing, and maybe someone else will need to write something like this in the future… in which case, please steal our copy. ↩ Research that shows that having attended a top school isn’t very predictive and that, while experience at a top company is somewhat predictive, it’s not the most important thing: Lessons from 3,000 technical interviews… or how what you do after graduation matters way more than where you went to school We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered. It didn't. Lessons from a year’s worth of hiring data ↩ ↩2 Anyone who’s read my writing for a long time will pause here and wonder why I’m OK with resumes and recommending anything about reading them. Until recently, I was stalwartly against resumes and convinced that they carried no signal whatsoever. Then, as part of the recruiter study I mentioned, we built some simple ML models to judge resumes and compared their performance to human recruiters. They all outperformed recruiters, and that surprising result made me reverse my stance. ↩ First study (2014): https://interviewing.io/blog/resumes-suck-heres-the-data Second study (2024): https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes ↩ There are other gaps that start way before someone gets to college. Enumerating the is out of scope of this piece, but this writeup by the National Math and Science Initiative is a good place to start. ↩",

This leaves open the possibility that what we were measuring was not exactly a return to LeetCode but rather the effect of some third variable that increases both LeetCode activity and job prospects. For example, say MIT has a course that emphasizes coding puzzles, and MIT grads also get better jobs. In that case, what might look like a LeetCode benefit is actually an MIT benefit, and controlling for that would make the apparent benefit disappear. At the very least, though, these patterns are informative about the typical profile of successful engineers, which is likely a useful thing to emulate in general. Also, remember that our data still shows solving a healthy number of questions regardless of their difficulty can boost your chances of getting through difficult interviews. By definition, many people can pass interviews with far fewer problems completed, and many will pass after doing more problems. ↩",

You are trying to join the manager, which is why it's okay to use their work email address. ↩ Many people think that for something to be worth mentioning, it has to have gone viral.

          "content": "Footnotes First, here’s how we got to these rankings. We asked each engineer who took our survey to rank all the channels they used to get in the door, from best to worst. Then we tallied up the points (+1 for best two channels, -1 for worst two). We didn’t do a more granular point system (e.g., +2 and -2) because the difference between the top two channels wasn’t always 2X, and generally, from talking to our users, preferences were somewhat muddy. As such, these results are directionally correct, but we didn’t feel comfortable numerically comparing them to one another. Finally, we divided the total tally by the number of times that channel came up. As a result, we were able to rank channels from most effective to least effective. ↩ This is why I generally view resume writers as selling snake oil. Either you have the things recruiters are looking for or you don’t. If you don’t, no amount of wordsmithing your bullet points or reorganizing the page is going to make a significant difference. Sure, check your resume for typos, and make sure that it reads decently well. Any more time invested in your resume after those basic things will have diminishing returns. Beware of anyone who tells you otherwise, and beware of any products or services who charge for resume review. ↩ We realize that recruiters won’t always have access to your resume when doing outreach and are likely looking at your LinkedIn instead. The same advice stands. Make sure that your About section has all the most important tidbits about you, front and center. Also, even though we didn’t see the same strong preference for FAANGs and URM status when applying online (more on that in the next section), making these types of changes to your resume certainly won’t hurt. ↩ Of course we don’t share the point of view that you can only be a good candidate if you have a brand-name company on your resume. However, many recruiters do, and they are still ignoring this channel. ↩ We’d argue that the value to companies is limited as well. Though there are a handful of excellent agency recruiters out there, most are terrible. The hard thing is that, as an employer, you can’t immediately tell who’s terrible, and you end up wasting a bunch of time reviewing profiles of candidates who might look promising on the surface, but because of selection bias (these are the people who decided to work with bad agency recruiters, after all) are not a fit. That or they’re not interested in your company (and have possibly never even opted in to talk to you) or both. ↩ At larger companies, recruiting is usually split into two functions: sourcing (these are the people who reach out to candidates) and recruiting (these are the people who manage candidates’ journey through the process and extend offers). In this post, for simplicity, we’re lumping them together because separating them out would change some of the details but wouldn’t change the key takeaways. ↩ Note that if you’re interested in smaller startups (Series A and below), you can substitute “founder” for “hiring manager” in the steps below. Founders are the most incentivized to get shit done and take risks, regardless of company size and stage, but at larger startups, they may be less likely to read cold emails because they get bombarded with all manners of requests and sales pitches. At a Series B or C company or at public companies with fewer than, say, 3000 employees, in addition to hiring managers, you should also target Directors and VPs — they have the power to get things done and aren’t so far removed from feeling the pain of not filling roles that making an extra hire or two is out of their purview. At large public companies, targeting Directors and above doesn’t make much sense — they ARE too far removed from doing the work to make individual hires. If you do contact them, the best outcome is that they’ll pass you on to one of their direct reports. ↩",

Take-home assignments could, in theory, be great for both companies and candidates. What better, fairer way to evaluate someone’s ability to do the work… than to have them do the work? Unfortunately, in practice, take-homes typically suck for engineers. We surveyed almost 700 of our users about their experiences with take-homes and interviewed a handful more for deeper insights. We learned a lot—mostly about candidates' poor experiences and negative feelings toward take-homes. They take a lot of time. They don’t respect candidates’ time. Candidates often get no feedback. And candidates are almost never compensated. The good news? Turns out there are some pretty simple things companies can do to vastly improve their take-home assignments. But before we dive into that… Why do companies use take-home assignments? Take-homes vary a ton by role and company in terms of the types of questions, subject matter, length, and intensity. At their simplest, take-homes can be the same questions as in an algorithmic interview, except done asynchronously. The other extreme is asking candidates to build an entire app and deploy it. We were surprised to see how often companies use take-homes. About 85% of our users got one at some point in their career, independent of their experience level. Of the users who encountered them, they tended to see them as part of the process about 20% of the time, again, independent of their experience level1. Why are take-homes relatively popular among employers? They mostly use them to save time in the hiring process. There are, however, some more noble reasons a company might use a take-home assignment: Get better signal during the interview process, as a take-home can be more indicative of actual work Get a candidate's best work out of them in a lower-stress environment than a live algorithmic interview and/or attract candidates who don’t like algorithmic interviews (of which there are plenty) Broaden the candidate pool by offering a way in for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds—in lieu of a resume screen, which they’d likely fail, candidates can do choose to do an assignment Accordingly, here’s the relevant part of a great conversation between Vincent Woo of CoderPad and Patrick McKenzie (known to Hacker News folks as patio11) of Stripe, formerly of Starfighter. Vincent: What general sort of high level change do you think that recruiters at tech companies that are roughly Stripe’s size or bigger ought to make? Patrick: If I could wave a magic wand and sell the world on one concept, it would be selling the world on the desirability of work sample testing… where the way to tell if someone is good at something is to have them do the something. Despite enthusiasm for the theory of take-homes and some very well-intentioned reasons, candidates overwhelmingly don’t like take-homes. Here’s why. Why don’t candidates like take-homes? It’s about value asymmetry. Though users expressed a lot of frustration with take-homes, we were surprised to see very few take a hard-line stance and refuse to do them. Only 6% outright refuse, and 66% of people complete take-homes all or most of the time. Surprisingly, these stats didn’t really change when we looked only at senior engineers. I was expecting that experienced engineers would do them almost never, if at all, but that’s not what the data shows. It’s possible that seniors are just louder in their disapproval. Nevertheless, the more desirable a company, the more likely candidates will do the take-home and feel OK about it—70% told us they completed them because they “Really wanted to work at the company and were willing to do what it took.” I found Weedmaps \\[to be\\] a very interesting company. They were the first marijuana related company to IPO. So you'd be on the frontier working for them. I found that exciting. So I applied and they had \\[a\\] take-home. I was like, sure, of course I’ll do this. Other reasons our users gave for completion included: “Because the take-home would be discussed at the onsite” (38%) and “Interesting/cool assignment” (37%). However, many of those who did finish them had such a poor experience that they said they’d never apply to certain companies ever again. We’ll talk about what makes the experience poor in a little bit. Of the people who refused to do at least one take-home at some point in their career, here were their reasons. Numbers don’t add up to 100 because it was a multi-select poll. In addition, we obviously don’t know how often take-homes are boring or unclear in the wild (probably often!), nor do we know how often companies pay people to do them (our guess, based on some napkin math, is >10% of the time). So we don’t have the true denominator for these stats. Nevertheless, we found these results insightful. The common thread among all of these reasons is value asymmetry. The worst take-homes feel unrewarding to candidates. Even exploitative. Take-home assignments ask a lot of candidates: a significant investment of their time, with an often unclear scope, no guarantee of progressing to the next round, often without feedback, and almost always without compensation. Meanwhile, the company has basically invested nothing, except to send the task. We heard this a lot. When I'm interviewing, I look for things that are proxies for valuing team members… or not. If they want me to do a take-home test, and they haven't even spent 30 minutes on a phone screen, I begin to sense an asymmetry in our relationship, with their time and resources being very valuable, and mine not being valuable at all. A divergence between how much effort they want me to put in, and how much they want to put in themselves. It signals that they are more worried about their time than mine, their costs than mine. It also means they underestimate how much effort it takes to write code, so that if I go to work for them, I am likely to face demands to work uncompensated overtime to meet their optimistic estimates. Spending five hours on their one-hour test for nothing leaves hard feelings. And if they ghost me after the test, I will happily tell every developer who asks what cheapskates they are. Is there any relationship between who candidates are and their willingness to do take-homes? Perhaps surprisingly, our data says no. We ran a regression to compare our survey respondents’ interview performance on our platform to how likely they were to do take-homes. The relationship was so weak as to be negligible. Similarly, we ran a regression to see if people who look good on paper are more or less likely to do take-homes. The relationship there was negligible as well. In other words, contrary to some popular opinions, you’re not necessarily weeding out your best candidates by doing take-homes, whether you define “best” in terms of how their resume looks or how they perform in interviews. How companies can make take-homes better (and why they probably should) After reading the stats above, you might think that, despite their grumblings, candidates generally do take-homes, and the best candidates won’t be weeded out. So, if you’re one of the many companies that uses them, it may not make sense to invest your limited time into making them better. It’s not that simple. For some companies, like the FAANGs, who have extremely strong brands and are known to pay well, changes are probably not worth it, especially in this market, where junior and senior engineers are willing to jump through more hoops than ever before. If you’re not a FAANG, though, listen up. Here are some questions you can ask yourself to figure out if you should indeed make some changes to your take-homes. First, take an honest look in the mirror and ask yourself about your brand strength. Are you a household name? Does having you on candidates’ resumes give them automatic prestige? Are you known to pay above market? If the answer to all of these questions isn’t a resounding yes, your brand strength is probably not strong enough to make people jump through hoops. Here’s a sketch to drive that point home. Unless you have a ton of brand strength, candidates’ willingness to jump through hoops drops off sharply. In fairness, I drew this sketch in a boom market. Maybe it’s a bit less steep now, but honestly, I’m not sure. If you aren’t maxing out on brand strength, there are two questions you should ask yourself: What is my take-home completion rate? What is my offer acceptance rate? If your completion rate is below, say, 60% (our data shows that candidates complete take-homes around 62% of the time), then it’s DEFINITELY time to make a change. Honestly, regardless of what our data says, if people aren’t completing them at least 85% of the time, it’s probably time to make a change—losing more than 15% of your candidates to attrition at any given stage in the funnel is bad. What about your offer acceptance rate? If it’s less than 50% and you’re using a take-home already, there’s an opportunity to make some improvements. You might be wondering what this has to do with take-homes in the first place. To answer that, let’s change how we think about different parts of the interview process. At face value, every part of the process is there to vet candidates, to determine if they’re the right fit for your organization. However, when used correctly, every part of your process should become a selling vehicle as well. This is especially important for companies who do not have a strong, well-known brand. The FAANGs can get away with using their interview processes primarily as vetting exercises because candidates are already sold on the pay or prestige or sometimes on the work and the product. When you don’t have an established brand, the candidates who come to you are, at best, open to learning more, and the interview process is the instrument that teaches them. Wield it accordingly. Though we strongly advocate coming up with great, unique interview questions2 and making sure you have great interviewers, if your process does have a take-home component, it is one of the more overlooked parts of the process when it comes to selling. You have the opportunity to have someone do the actual work that you do! This is your chance to pick the coolest stuff you’ve worked on and serve it up to someone on a platter and make it stick in their brains and make them imagine what it’d be like to work on these kinds of problems every day! Why wouldn’t you jump at this opportunity? You may think you don’t need to sell in this market. But just because employers have all the power right now, it doesn’t mean that will always be the case. And great senior engineers still have a lot of leverage. If, after considering your take-home completion rate and your offer acceptance rate, it looks like you do need to make some changes, here are some practical tips, based on what we’ve learned from talking to our users (overwhelmingly senior engineers who are targeting top-tier companies—probably the people you want). Let’s start with what we just talked about: using the take-home as a selling vehicle. Make them interesting and relevant to the actual work You're getting a chance to spend a couple of hours with somebody in a take-home (metaphorically). Why wouldn't you do everything you can to get them excited? Pick a problem that you've worked on, and get them hooked on it. Pick the kernel of an interesting problem that you've solved, and build something around it that will challenge candidates. Something that gets them thinking, “I could have done that better” or “This is a different or more efficient way to do it.” That's going to be more effective than the standard perks many companies offer. \\[Best take-home I’ve seen was an\\] open-ended system design question on the type of system I would work on, was meant to simulate a team discussion on the system we needed to build, and was a great way for me to start thinking about what I'd be working on there. One way you could do this, is to have your engineering team keep a shared doc of ‘cool’ solutions they've found, or new things they've tried. These can serve as jumping-off points for creating your take-homes. The… challenge was for an internal tooling team that specialized in incident response tools; their challenge was to create a scaled down version of a tool already in use at the company. The focus was more on understanding the domain and customer than wiring up a bunch of complicated stuff, and it was a delight. It being a greenfield also gave you an opportunity to showcase some software design skills. I did not get this job, but enjoyed the experience and still feel connected to the team. It was conceptually related to the sort of work the team was performing, but it was simplified and stand-alone enough to clearly not be unpaid labor for their product. Just be sure that when you come up with a practical problem that you strip out the annoying parts and focus only on the juicy kernel of the problem, the part that’s actually cool and lets the candidate be smart and creative. Don’t make them do grunt work or wrestle with their dev environment! \\[This\\] was for a tooling team in Support, where they didn't have a lot of experience creating challenges or interviewing. One of the engineers took a difficult task that he had accomplished recently and just made that the take home challenge. It involved a lot of Ruby version conflict debugging. It was completely demoralizing and felt like hazing. Keep them short Candidates overwhelmingly favor take-homes that respect their time, i.e., short ones. The best were short and brief, took no more than 2 hours and were directly related to what I would be doing on the job. Best are realistic and time bound, i.e., low time investment required. Short and quick take-homes are great. Over 80% of survey respondents said that take-homes should take 4 hours or less, and a plurality thought that they should take 2 hours. The outliers are interesting. Unfortunately, we missed an opportunity to ask about those in the survey. Take-homes being short in theory is one thing… but we got a lot of feedback that take-homes often go far beyond how long companies tell candidates that take-homes should take. Have someone on your team QA the actual length of the assignment This disconnect between actual time and expected time is another instance of value asymmetry: companies didn't even bother to have someone on their team do the take-home themselves and time it. I've done a couple of algorithm questions as take-homes that the interviewer said should take an hour. They routinely take longer than that. Companies will say, ‘don’t spend more than X hours on it,’ but then it actually takes 5X that amount. It's just too much time. And most of the time they didn’t give feedback at all even though I spent so much time on it. Companies should clearly communicate the expected time commitment for a take-home. And they should be realistic about how much time it should take. Best was an interesting problem with a realistic time frame. They estimated 2 hours and it took me exactly that, which was refreshing and made the process seem fair. I've done a couple of exercises where they were truly respectful of my time. The tasks were small, clearly defined, and they gave me a realistic timeframe to complete them. For the best take-home I did, the company told me: ‘Tell us when you're going to start, and you'll have 4 hours. We'll be available over email that whole time, and we'll answer your questions within minutes.’ That felt respectful of my time, and was a more reliable signal of my capabilities than a 20-minute algorithms exercise. To get a realistic estimate, companies could simply QA their own take-homes—just by having someone on your team take it, and time them. Still, some candidates will spend more time anyway, because they really want to work for a certain company. And it can be easy for candidates to go down a rabbit hole and get most of a take-home done in the first few hours, then spend another day or more, perfecting it to give themselves a better chance. Do you want me to literally only work two hours on something that's clearly going to take 10 to really be able to have a conversation with you about how I think about things? Because two hours of decisions isn't as good as 10 hours of decisions. It’s okay if candidates want to put in extra time, but it should be made clear that that's not the expectation. Set a clear scope, related to the role The scope was poorly defined, which made the assignment not only tedious, but also seemed like a waste of time. Having clear, straightforward instructions can significantly enhance the take-home experience for candidates, making them feel purposeful and relevant. The best take-homes are those that directly align with the actual job. When candidates are asked to solve a simplified version of a real problem your company is facing, it not only tests relevant skills, but also gives a candidate insight into what work at your company would be like, which is really what selling is. (This is, of course, assuming that you believe what you’re working on is cool… If you don’t, how will you ever convince others?) One was a great learning experience because I had to solve a problem similar to what I would face in the job. It was concise and focused. Being able to ask questions before or during the take-home, e.g., having a direct contact point who’s an engineer at the company, can also be a big plus. Be thoughtful about where in your process you insert the take-home, and give candidates a choice between a take-home and something else For take-homes early in the process, before speaking to a human We expect that many of the companies reading this piece have take-homes as the first step in their process, before ever talking to a human. This decision isn’t very popular. If a company calls me for a screening interview, it means they've read my resume and cover letter, and not immediately dismissed my application as inappropriate. It also means they're putting a person on a phone call with me for the duration of the screening interview. This is symmetric, my effort matches theirs. \\[I\\] did a take home that was automatically sent to me after applying, before even speaking to a human. The feedback was 'you are too expensive,' no feedback on the coding. Company needs to build an investment with the candidate first—they shouldn't ask for it before meeting the candidate at least once. That said, take-homes can be a great way to let candidates who don’t look good on paper show what they can do, and those candidates are more likely to complete them. To prevent candidate unhappiness/attrition, give them a choice. Either submit a resume or do the take-home assignment or both. If you go this route, though, design a take-home that you trust. We’ve seen companies take this approach and then throw out perfect-scoring take-homes when they didn’t like the resume. If you use a take-home, then respect your candidates enough to follow up with the ones who’ve done well, even if they don’t look good on paper. For take-homes later in the process Another way to make take-homes purposeful is to give your candidates an explicit choice about whether they’d rather do a technical interview or a take-home. Engineers are, in fact, split on which they’d prefer. Giving them a choice allows them to showcase their skills in the format they prefer and feel best prepared for. If you have good questions, you should be able to get good signal from either. Only 10% of respondents told us that they were given the choice of take-home versus technical interview. So there is an opportunity for more companies to do this. It's a candidate-friendly gesture that shows empathy and can help candidates shine. Many candidates have spent months preparing for standard technical interviews. So it can feel anticlimactic when they find out that a company they're excited about doesn't do them. Others get so nervous in a live interview that they don’t perform. I rarely don't pass take-home assessments, but I often fail to pass live interviews. Interestingly, one user we interviewed told us that they spend far less time on a take-home compared to preparing for a live technical interview. And because of that they prefer take-homes. I prefer take-homes over all other assessments because I find I spend far less time on take-homes then I do preparing for live interviews. It's hard to overestimate the amount of extra time I spend preparing for a technical interview, compared to doing a take-home—for me it’s maybe 10 times as much. I've spent hundreds of hours, maybe 500 hours, over the course of my career preparing for technical interviews. And if I have one pop up, I can't just drop everything and do it right away. I have to spend a lot of extra time just ramping up for a particular interview, in addition to the hundreds of hours that I've done. Give candidates a good, rational reason to do the take-home Clear communication about the purpose of a take-home in the hiring process, as well as why it’s rational to spend time on it, is important for candidates. It’s a way to make sure it feels purposeful and not like a random task. One way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to replace some parts of your process with it. A standard process without a take-home has a recruiter call followed by a technical phone screen followed by an onsite (virtual or otherwise). The technical phone screen usually lasts about an hour. The onsite usually lasts 6 hours. Let’s say your take-home takes 2 hours to do. You can make it replace the phone screen and one of the onsite rounds, which nets out to the same number of hours spent. If you go this route, we recommend doing the math explicitly for candidates and showing them that the time they spend on the take-home is equivalent to the time they’d be spending on a process without it. Another way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to incorporate it into the onsite, where at least one of the rounds, if not more, will include a code review and/or thoughtful discussion about tradeoffs and choices made. This should be standard practice, but isn’t always. 32% of our users said companies had told them this, and it was the reason they decided to do a take-home. The best take-homes were ones that we discussed in the first rounds of interviews. The worst ones were ones that I submitted and we never talked about them again. Ideally, you do both of these things together, and very clearly explain to candidates both the math and how the take-home informs the content of the onsite. Compensate candidates Probably the most striking result of our survey was that 58% of candidates think that they deserve compensation for completing take-homes. Yet only 4% reported ever receiving it. Compensation can shift candidate perceptions of the hiring process and of the company: They compensated me for my time, which made the process feel very professional and respectful. It was a completely open source codebase and so their process was the exact same as someone that was an employee: here's the ticket with the information to do it, set up the environment, download all the code, get everything running. They gave me a few different tasks I could choose from, I could pick two, and if I completed them I would be compensated a fixed rate, which was $100 for each task. Which in terms of the time I spent on it, is still really cheap for them. If candidates know they’re going to be paid for their work on a take-home, they’ll be more likely to complete it as well. Compensating candidates is a clear gesture that shows you value their time and effort, that there’s more symmetry in the relationship. It also goes hand-in-hand with time: paying also forces a company to scope the take-home to a reasonable number of hours. So it's a forcing function for good behavior—if you can’t afford much, then don't make the take-home too long! How much to pay? Responses about how much companies should pay for take-home assignments were split. Fixed amounts: Just over half of respondents (52%) suggested specific and reasonable fixed amounts, ranging from $50 to $500. Hourly rates: The other almost half (47%) favored an hourly rate, with suggestions ranging from $50 an hour and upward (average of $217 an hour). Some suggested that the rate should correspond to the salary of the position being applied for, or be comparable to what an employee at that level and company would earn. As one user put it: Maybe just pay market? One antipattern when it comes to comp is NOT having a set rate, asking the candidate to name their price, and thereby putting the candidate in a position where they feel like they need to negotiate. In this scenario, the candidate has to negotiate twice: once on the take-home and once on their actual comp, with the worry that negotiating too aggressively on the take-home might count them out… or not aggressively enough anchoring the company to lower compensation down the line. No one needs these mind-games in an already stressful process. Just have a set rate, for god’s sake. Symbolic compensation: This is probably not the best option, but a handful of survey respondents (1%) did mention that a minimal symbolic compensation would do. While 1% is small, we found this interesting to include because, when we interviewed people, two of them mentioned this. I think any compensation at all has symbolic value. A $100 Amazon card would impress me. A $50 Amazon card and a company t-shirt would at least not insult me. It’s kind of a consolation prize to say, ‘No hard feelings.’ I feel like a couple meal vouchers would do it these days. Of these options, we’d recommend a reasonable fixed amount based on the task, and the actual time it’s supposed to take. And of course you know how long it takes because you had one of your engineers do it themselves, right? Right?? Give feedback Lack of feedback was the primary reason our survey respondents said their experience with a given company was bad. Regardless of interview type, we’re always pro feedback, but feedback is especially important for take-homes, because in a way they ask more of a candidate. Offering constructive feedback, regardless of the hiring decision, respects the candidate's effort on the take-home. Despite the time and effort they invested in completing take-homes, many of our survey respondents said they received no feedback at all. This was seen as demoralizing, and it deterred candidates from applying to future opportunities at those companies. Getting rejected without having a chance to discuss the code with anyone is a terrible experience. It is really discouraging spending a large amount of time to find out you are rejected without explanations. They provided no feedback after submission, which made the whole effort feel unappreciated and one-sided. Incidentally, the main reason companies don’t give feedback is fear of getting sued. As it turns out, literally ZERO companies (at least in the US) have ever been sued by an engineer who received constructive post-interview feedback. Thanks to Dan Fennessy for all the behind-the-scenes work on this post.

What better, fairer way to evaluate someone’s ability to do the work… than to have them do the work?\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, in practice, take-homes typically suck for engineers.\\\\n\\\\nWe surveyed almost 700 of our users about their experiences with take-homes and interviewed a handful more for deeper insights. We learned a lot—mostly about candidates' poor experiences and negative feelings toward take-homes. They take a lot of time. They don’t respect candidates’ time. Candidates often get no feedback. And candidates are almost never compensated. \\\\n\\\\nThe good news? Turns out there are some pretty simple things companies can do to vastly improve their take-home assignments. But before we dive into that…\\\\n\\\\n## Why do companies use take-home assignments?\\\\n\\\\nTake-homes vary a ton by role and company in terms of the types of questions, subject matter, length, and intensity. At their simplest, take-homes can be the same questions as in an algorithmic interview, except done asynchronously. The other extreme is asking candidates to build an entire app and deploy it.\\\\n\\\\nWe were surprised to see how often companies use take-homes. About 85% of our users got one at some point in their career, independent of their experience level. Of the users who encountered them, they tended to see them as part of the process about 20% of the time, again, independent of their experience level\\[^1\\]. \\\\n\\\\nWhy are take-homes relatively popular among employers? They mostly use them to save time in the hiring process. There are, however, some more noble reasons a company might use a take-home assignment:\\\\n\\\\n\\* Get better signal during the interview process, as a take-home can be more indicative of actual work \\\\n\\* Get a candidate's best work out of them in a lower-stress environment than a live algorithmic interview and/or attract candidates who don’t like algorithmic interviews (of which there are \\[plenty\\](https://hn.algolia.com/?q=coding+interviews)) \\\\n\\* Broaden the candidate pool by offering a way in for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds—in lieu of a resume screen, which they’d likely fail, candidates can do choose to do an assignment\\\\n\\\\nAccordingly, here’s the relevant part of a great conversation between Vincent Woo of CoderPad and Patrick McKenzie (known to Hacker News folks as patio11) of Stripe, formerly of \\[Starfighter\\](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2015/03/09/announcing-starfighter/).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003ciframe width=\\\\\"720\\\\\" height=\\\\\"405\\\\\" src=\\\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2AutFcXgKIM?si=3amHzY87yufcg35M\\\\u0026amp;start=1739\\\\\" title=\\\\\"YouTube video player\\\\\" frameborder=\\\\\"0\\\\\" allow=\\\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\\\\" allowfullscreen\\\\u003e\\\\u003c/iframe\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\nVincent: \\*What general sort of high level change do you think that recruiters at tech\\\\ncompanies that are roughly Stripe’s size or bigger ought to make?\\*\\\\n\\\\nPatrick: \\*If I could wave a magic wand and sell the world on one concept, it would be selling the world on the desirability of work sample testing… where the way to tell if someone is good at something is to have them do the something.\\*\\\\n\\\\nDespite enthusiasm for the theory of take-homes and some very well-intentioned reasons, candidates overwhelmingly don’t like take-homes. Here’s why.\\\\n\\\\n## Why don’t candidates like take-homes? It’s about value asymmetry.\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Though users expressed a lot of frustration with take-homes, we were surprised to see very few take a hard-line stance and refuse to do them. Only 6% outright refuse, and 66% of people complete take-homes all or most of the time.\\*\\* Surprisingly, these stats didn’t really change when we looked only at senior engineers. I was expecting that experienced engineers would do them almost never, if at all, but that’s not what the data shows. It’s possible that seniors are just louder in their disapproval.\\\\n\\\\n!\\[How often people do take-homes.png\\](https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/How\\_often\\_people\\_do\\_take\\_homes\\_e85d712b9b.png)\\\\n\\\\nNevertheless, the more desirable a company, the more likely candidates will do the take-home and feel OK about it—70% told us they completed them because they “Really wanted to work at the company and were willing to do what it took.”\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*I found Weedmaps \\[to be\\] a very interesting company. They were the first marijuana related company to IPO. So you'd be on the frontier working for them. I found that exciting. So I applied and they had \\[a\\] take-home. I was like, sure, of course I’ll do this.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nOther reasons our users gave for completion included: “Because the take-home would be discussed at the onsite” (38%) and “Interesting/cool assignment” (37%). However, many of those who did finish them had such a poor experience that they said they’d never apply to certain companies ever again. We’ll talk about what makes the experience poor in a little bit.\\\\n\\\\nOf the people who refused to do at least one take-home at some point in their career, here were their reasons.\\\\n\\\\n::iio-image{alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" caption=\\\\\"Numbers don’t add up to 100 because it was a multi-select poll. In addition, we obviously don’t know how often take-homes are boring or unclear in the wild (probably often!), nor do we know how often companies pay people to do them (our guess, based on some napkin math, is \\\\u003e10% of the time). So we don’t have the true denominator for these stats. Nevertheless, we found these results insightful.\\\\\" height=\\\\\"600\\\\\" src=\\\\\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Why\\_people\\_don\\_t\\_do\\_take\\_homes\\_f138c44568.png\\\\\" title=\\\\\"\\\\\" width=\\\\\"600\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*The common thread among all of these reasons is value asymmetry.\\*\\* The worst take-homes feel unrewarding to candidates. Even exploitative. Take-home assignments ask a lot of candidates: a significant investment of their time, with an often unclear scope, no guarantee of progressing to the next round, often without feedback, and almost always without compensation. Meanwhile, the company has basically invested nothing, except to send the task. We heard this a lot.\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*When I'm interviewing, I look for things that are proxies for valuing team members… or not. If they want me to do a take-home test, and they haven't even spent 30 minutes on a phone screen, I begin to sense an asymmetry in our relationship, with their time and resources being very valuable, and mine not being valuable at all.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*A divergence between how much effort they want me to put in, and how much they want to put in themselves. It signals that they are more worried about their time than mine, their costs than mine. It also means they underestimate how much effort it takes to write code, so that if I go to work for them, I am likely to face demands to work uncompensated overtime to meet their optimistic estimates.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*Spending five hours on their one-hour test for nothing leaves hard feelings. And if they ghost me after the test, I will happily tell every developer who asks what cheapskates they are.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n## Is there any relationship between who candidates are and their willingness to do take-homes?\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps surprisingly, our data says no. We ran a regression to compare our survey respondents’ interview performance on our platform to how likely they were to do take-homes. The relationship was so weak as to be negligible.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, we ran a regression to see if people who \\_look\\_ good on paper are more or less likely to do take-homes. The relationship there was negligible as well.\\\\n\\\\nIn other words, contrary to some popular opinions, you’re not necessarily weeding out your best candidates by doing take-homes, whether you define “best” in terms of how their resume looks or how they perform in interviews.\\\\n\\\\n## How companies can make take-homes better (and why they probably should)\\\\n\\\\nAfter reading the stats above, you might think that, despite their grumblings, candidates generally do take-homes, and the best candidates won’t be weeded out. So, if you’re one of the many companies that uses them, it may not make sense to invest your limited time into making them better. It’s not that simple. For some companies, like the FAANGs, who have extremely strong brands and are known to pay well, changes are probably not worth it, especially in this market, where junior and senior engineers are willing to jump through more hoops than ever before.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re not a FAANG, though, listen up. Here are some questions you can ask yourself to figure out if you should indeed make some changes to your take-homes.\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*First, take an honest look in the mirror and ask yourself about your brand strength. Are you a household name? Does having you on candidates’ resumes give them automatic prestige? Are you known to pay above market?\\*\\* If the answer to \\_all\\_ of these questions isn’t a resounding yes, your brand strength is probably not strong enough to make people jump through hoops.\\\\n\\\\nHere’s a sketch to drive that point home. Unless you have a ton of brand strength, candidates’ willingness to jump through hoops drops off sharply.\\\\n\\\\n::iio-image{alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" caption=\\\\\"In fairness, I drew this sketch in a boom market. Maybe it’s a bit less steep now, but honestly, I’m not sure.\\\\\" height=\\\\\"600\\\\\" src=\\\\\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/brand\\_strength\\_vs\\_value\\_asymmetry\\_4bc96b83d4.png\\\\\" title=\\\\\"\\\\\" width=\\\\\"600\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\nIf you aren’t maxing out on brand strength, there are two questions you should ask yourself: \\\\n\\\\n1. What is my take-home completion rate? \\\\n2. What is my offer acceptance rate? \\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*If your completion rate is below, say, 60% (our data shows that candidates complete take-homes around 62% of the time), then it’s DEFINITELY time to make a change.\\*\\* Honestly, regardless of what our data says, if people aren’t completing them at least 85% of the time, it’s \\_probably\\_ time to make a change—losing more than 15% of your candidates to attrition at any given stage in the funnel is bad.\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*What about your offer acceptance rate? If it’s less than 50% and you’re using a take-home already, there’s an opportunity to make some improvements.\\*\\* You might be wondering what this has to do with take-homes in the first place. To answer that, let’s change how we think about different parts of the interview process. At face value, every part of the process is there to vet candidates, to determine if they’re the right fit for your organization. However, when used correctly, every part of your process should become a selling vehicle as well. This is \\_especially\\_ important for companies who do not have a strong, well-known brand. The FAANGs can get away with using their interview processes primarily as vetting exercises because candidates are already sold on the pay or prestige or sometimes on the work and the product. When you don’t have an established brand, the candidates who come to you are, at best, open to learning more, and the interview process is the instrument that teaches them. Wield it accordingly. \\\\n\\\\nThough we strongly advocate coming up with \\[great, unique interview questions\\](https://interviewing.io/blog/best-technical-interviews-common)\\[^2\\] and making sure you have \\[great interviewers\\](https://interviewing.io/blog/we-have-the-best-technical-interviewers-heres-how-we-do-it), if your process does have a take-home component, it is one of the more overlooked parts of the process when it comes to selling. You have the opportunity to have someone \\_do the actual work that you do\\_! This is your chance to pick the coolest stuff you’ve worked on and serve it up to someone on a platter and make it stick in their brains and make them imagine what it’d be like to work on these kinds of problems every day! Why wouldn’t you jump at this opportunity? \\\\n\\\\nYou may think you don’t need to sell in this market. But just because employers have all the power right now, it doesn’t mean that will always be the case. And great senior engineers still have a lot of leverage. \\\\n\\\\nIf, after considering your take-home completion rate and your offer acceptance rate, it looks like you \\_do\\_ need to make some changes, here are some practical tips, based on what we’ve learned from talking to our users (overwhelmingly senior engineers who are targeting top-tier companies—probably the people you want). Let’s start with what we just talked about: using the take-home as a selling vehicle. \\\\n\\\\n### Make them interesting and relevant to the actual work\\\\n\\\\nYou're getting a chance to spend a couple of hours with somebody in a take-home (metaphorically). Why wouldn't you do everything you can to get them excited? \\*\\*Pick a problem that you've worked on, and get them hooked on it. Pick the kernel of an interesting problem that you've solved, and build something around it that will challenge candidates. Something that gets them thinking, “I could have done that better” or “This is a different or more efficient way to do it.” That's going to be more effective than the standard perks many companies offer.\\*\\* \\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\[Best take-home I’ve seen was an\\] open-ended system design question on the type of system I would work on, was meant to simulate a team discussion on the system we needed to build, and was a great way for me to start thinking about what I'd be working on there.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nOne way you could do this, is to have your engineering team keep a shared doc of ‘cool’ solutions they've found, or new things they've tried. These can serve as jumping-off points for creating your take-homes.\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*The… challenge was for an internal tooling team that specialized in incident response tools; their challenge was to create a scaled down version of a tool already in use at the company. The focus was more on understanding the domain and customer than wiring up a bunch of complicated stuff, and it was a delight. It being a greenfield also gave you an opportunity to showcase some software design skills. I did not get this job, but enjoyed the experience and still feel connected to the team.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*It was conceptually related to the sort of work the team was performing, but it was simplified and stand-alone enough to clearly not be unpaid labor for their product.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nJust be sure that when you come up with a practical problem that you strip out the annoying parts and focus only on the juicy kernel of the problem, the part that’s actually cool and lets the candidate be smart and creative. Don’t make them do grunt work or wrestle with their dev environment!\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\[This\\] was for a tooling team in Support, where they didn't have a lot of experience creating challenges or interviewing. One of the engineers took a difficult task that he had accomplished recently and just made that the take home challenge. It involved a lot of Ruby version conflict debugging. It was completely demoralizing and felt like hazing.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n### Keep them short\\\\n\\\\nCandidates overwhelmingly favor take-homes that respect their time, i.e., short ones.\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*The best were short and brief, took no more than 2 hours and were directly related to what I would be doing on the job.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Best are realistic and time bound, i.e., low time investment required.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Short and quick take-homes are great.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Over 80% of survey respondents said that take-homes should take 4 hours or less, and a plurality thought that they should take 2 hours.\\*\\*\\\\n\\\\n::iio-image{alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" caption=\\\\\"The outliers are interesting. Unfortunately, we missed an opportunity to ask about those in the survey.\\\\\" height=\\\\\"600\\\\\" src=\\\\\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/How\\_long\\_engineers\\_think\\_take\\_home\\_assignments\\_should\\_take\\_2a361d8e29.png\\\\\" title=\\\\\"\\\\\" width=\\\\\"600\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\nTake-homes being short in theory is one thing… but we got a lot of feedback that take-homes often go far beyond how long companies tell candidates that take-homes should take.\\\\n\\\\n#### Have someone on your team QA the actual length of the assignment\\\\n\\\\nThis disconnect between actual time and expected time is another instance of value asymmetry: companies didn't even bother to have someone on their team do the take-home themselves and time it.\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*I've done a couple of algorithm questions as take-homes that the interviewer said should take an hour. They routinely take longer than that.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Companies will say, ‘don’t spend more than X hours on it,’ but then it actually takes 5X that amount. It's just too much time. And most of the time they didn’t give feedback at all even though I spent so much time on it.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nCompanies should clearly communicate the expected time commitment for a take-home. And they should be realistic about how much time it should take.\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Best was an interesting problem with a realistic time frame. They estimated 2 hours and it took me exactly that, which was refreshing and made the process seem fair.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*I've done a couple of exercises where they were truly respectful of my time. The tasks were small, clearly defined, and they gave me a realistic timeframe to complete them.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*For the best take-home I did, the company told me: ‘Tell us when you're going to start, and you'll have 4 hours. We'll be available over email that whole time, and we'll answer your questions within minutes.’ That felt respectful of my time, and was a more reliable signal of my capabilities than a 20-minute algorithms exercise.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*To get a realistic estimate, companies could simply QA their own take-homes—just by having someone on your team take it, and time them.\\*\\*\\\\n\\\\nStill, some candidates will spend more time anyway, because they really want to work for a certain company. And it can be easy for candidates to go down a rabbit hole and get most of a take-home done in the first few hours, then spend another day or more, perfecting it to give themselves a better chance.\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Do you want me to literally only work two hours on something that's clearly going to take 10 to really be able to have a conversation with you about how I think about things? Because two hours of decisions isn't as good as 10 hours of decisions.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\nIt’s okay if candidates want to put in extra time, but it should be made clear that that's not the expectation. \\\\n\\\\n### Set a clear scope, related to the role\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*The scope was poorly defined, which made the assignment not only tedious, but also seemed like a waste of time.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Having clear, straightforward instructions can significantly enhance the take-home experience for candidates, making them feel purposeful and relevant. The best take-homes are those that directly align with the actual job.\\*\\* When candidates are asked to solve a simplified version of a real problem your company is facing, it not only tests relevant skills, but also gives a candidate insight into what work at your company would be like, which is really what selling is. (This is, of course, assuming that you believe what you’re working on is cool… If you don’t, how will you ever convince others?)\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*One was a great learning experience because I had to solve a problem similar to what I would face in the job. It was concise and focused.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nBeing able to ask questions before or during the take-home, e.g., having a direct contact point who’s an engineer at the company, can also be a big plus.\\\\n\\\\n### Be thoughtful about where in your process you insert the take-home, and give candidates a choice between a take-home and something else\\\\n\\\\n#### For take-homes early in the process, before speaking to a human\\\\n\\\\nWe expect that many of the companies reading this piece have take-homes as the first step in \\\\ntheir process, before ever talking to a human. This decision isn’t very popular.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003e\\*If a company calls me for a screening interview, it means they've read my resume and cover letter, and not immediately dismissed my application as inappropriate. It also means they're putting a person on a phone call with me for the duration of the screening interview. This is symmetric, my effort matches theirs.\\*\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*\\[I\\] did a take home that was automatically sent to me after applying, before even speaking to a human. The feedback was 'you are too expensive,' no feedback on the coding.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Company needs to build an investment with the candidate first—they shouldn't ask for it before meeting the candidate at least once.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*That said, take-homes can be a great way to let candidates who don’t look good on paper show what they can do, and those candidates are more likely to complete them.\\*\\* To prevent candidate unhappiness/attrition, give them a choice. Either submit a resume or do the take-home assignment or both. If you go this route, though, design a take-home that you trust. We’ve seen companies take this approach and then throw out perfect-scoring take-homes when they didn’t like the resume. If you use a take-home, then respect your candidates enough to follow up with the ones who’ve done well, even if they don’t look good on paper. \\\\n\\\\n#### For take-homes later in the process\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Another way to make take-homes purposeful is to give your candidates an explicit choice about whether they’d rather do a technical interview or a take-home.\\*\\* Engineers are, in fact, split on which they’d prefer. Giving them a choice allows them to showcase their skills in the format they prefer and feel best prepared for. If you have good questions, you should be able to get good signal from either. \\\\n\\\\nOnly 10% of respondents told us that they were given the choice of take-home versus technical interview. So there is an opportunity for more companies to do this. It's a candidate-friendly gesture that shows empathy and can help candidates shine.\\\\n\\\\nMany candidates have spent months preparing for standard technical interviews. So it can feel anticlimactic when they find out that a company they're excited about doesn't do them. Others get so nervous in a live interview that they don’t perform.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003e\\*I rarely don't pass take-home assessments, but I often fail to pass live interviews.\\*\\\\n\\\\nInterestingly, one user we interviewed told us that they spend far less time on a take-home compared to preparing for a live technical interview. And because of that they prefer take-homes.\\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*I prefer take-homes over all other assessments because I find I spend far less time on take-homes then I do preparing for live interviews. It's hard to overestimate the amount of extra time I spend preparing for a technical interview, compared to doing a take-home—for me it’s maybe 10 times as much. I've spent hundreds of hours, maybe 500 hours, over the course of my career preparing for technical interviews. And if I have one pop up, I can't just drop everything and do it right away. I have to spend a lot of extra time just ramping up for a particular interview, in addition to the hundreds of hours that I've done.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\n### Give candidates a good, rational reason to do the take-home\\\\n\\\\nClear communication about the purpose of a take-home in the hiring process, as well as why it’s rational to spend time on it, is important for candidates. It’s a way to make sure it feels purposeful and not like a random task.\\\\n\\\\nOne way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to replace some parts of your process with it. A standard process without a take-home has a recruiter call followed by a technical phone screen followed by an onsite (virtual or otherwise). The technical phone screen usually lasts about an hour. The onsite usually lasts 6 hours.\\\\n\\\\nLet’s say your take-home takes 2 hours to do. You can make it replace the phone screen and one of the onsite rounds, which nets out to the same number of hours spent. If you go this route, we recommend doing the math \\_explicitly\\_ for candidates and showing them that the time they spend on the take-home is equivalent to the time they’d be spending on a process without it.\\\\n\\\\nAnother way to make the take-home feel deliberate is to incorporate it into the onsite, where at least one of the rounds, if not more, will include a code review and/or thoughtful discussion about tradeoffs and choices made. This should be standard practice, but isn’t always. 32% of our users said companies had told them this, and it was the reason they decided to do a take-home.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003e\\*The best take-homes were ones that we discussed in the first rounds of interviews. The worst ones were ones that I submitted and we never talked about them again.\\*\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Ideally, you do both of these things together, and very clearly explain to candidates both the math and how the take-home informs the content of the onsite.\\*\\*\\\\n\\\\n### Compensate candidates\\\\n\\\\nProbably the most striking result of our survey was that 58% of candidates think that they deserve compensation for completing take-homes. Yet only 4% reported ever receiving it. Compensation can shift candidate perceptions of the hiring process and of the company: \\\\n\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*They compensated me for my time, which made the process feel very professional and respectful.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*It was a completely open source codebase and so their process was the exact same as someone that was an employee: here's the ticket with the information to do it, set up the environment, download all the code, get everything running. They gave me a few different tasks I could choose from, I could pick two, and if I completed them I would be compensated a fixed rate, which was $100 for each task. Which in terms of the time I spent on it, is still really cheap for them.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nIf candidates know they’re going to be paid for their work on a take-home, they’ll be more likely to complete it as well.\\\\nCompensating candidates is a clear gesture that shows you value their time and effort, that there’s more symmetry in the relationship. It also goes hand-in-hand with time: paying also forces a company to scope the take-home to a reasonable number of hours. So it's a forcing function for good behavior—if you can’t afford much, then don't make the take-home too long!\\\\n\\\\n#### How much to pay?\\\\n\\\\nResponses about how much companies should pay for take-home assignments were split.\\\\n\\\\n1. \\*\\*Fixed amounts\\*\\*: Just over half of respondents (52%) suggested specific and reasonable fixed amounts, ranging from $50 to $500. \\\\n\\\\n2. \\*\\*Hourly rates\\*\\*: The other almost half (47%) favored an hourly rate, with suggestions ranging from $50 an hour and upward (average of $217 an hour). Some suggested that the rate should correspond to the salary of the position being applied for, or be comparable to what an employee at that level and company would earn. As one user put it: \\\\n\\\\n \\\\u003e\\*Maybe just pay market?\\*\\\\n\\\\n One antipattern when it comes to comp is NOT having a set rate, asking the candidate to name their price, and thereby putting the candidate in a position where they feel like they need to negotiate. In this scenario, the candidate has to negotiate twice: once on the take-home and once on their actual comp, with the worry that negotiating too aggressively on the take-home might count them out… or not aggressively enough anchoring the company to lower compensation down the line. No one needs these mind-games in an already stressful process. Just have a set rate, for god’s sake.\\\\n\\\\n3. \\*\\*Symbolic compensation\\*\\*: This is probably not the best option, but a handful of survey respondents (1%) did mention that a minimal symbolic compensation would do. While 1% is small, we found this interesting to include because, when we interviewed people, two of them mentioned this.\\\\n\\\\n :::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n \\*I think any compensation at all has symbolic value. A $100 Amazon card would impress me. A $50 Amazon card and a company t-shirt would at least not insult me. It’s kind of a consolation prize to say, ‘No hard feelings.’\\*\\\\n :::\\\\n :::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"lightgreen\\\\\"}\\\\n \\*I feel like a couple meal vouchers would do it these days.\\*\\\\n :::\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Of these options, we’d recommend a reasonable fixed amount based on the task, and the actual time it’s supposed to take.\\*\\* And of course you know how long it takes because you had one of your engineers do it themselves, right? Right??\\\\n\\\\n### Give feedback\\\\n\\\\n\\*\\*Lack of feedback was the primary reason our survey respondents said their experience with a given company was bad.\\*\\* Regardless of interview type, we’re always \\[pro feedback\\](https://interviewing.io/blog/why-giving-feedback-good-or-bad-will-help-you-hire), but feedback is especially important for take-homes, because in a way they ask more of a candidate. Offering constructive feedback, regardless of the hiring decision, respects the candidate's effort on the take-home.\\\\n\\\\nDespite the time and effort they invested in completing take-homes, many of our survey respondents said they received no feedback at all. This was seen as demoralizing, and it deterred candidates from applying to future opportunities at those companies.\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*Getting rejected without having a chance to discuss the code with anyone is a terrible experience.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*It is really discouraging spending a large amount of time to find out you are rejected without explanations.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n:::iio-blockquote{color=\\\\\"red\\\\\"}\\\\n\\*They provided no feedback after submission, which made the whole effort feel unappreciated and one-sided.\\*\\\\n:::\\\\n\\\\nIncidentally, the main reason companies don’t give feedback is fear of getting sued. As it turns out, \\[literally ZERO companies (at least in the US) have ever been sued by an engineer\\](https://interviewing.io/blog/no-engineer-has-ever-sued-a-company-because-of-constructive-post-interview-feedback-so-why-dont-employers-do-it) who received constructive post-interview feedback.\\\\n\\\\n\\_Thanks to \\[Dan Fennessy\\](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielfennessy/) for all the behind-the-scenes work on this post.\\_\\\\n\\\\nFootnotes:\\\\n\\\\n\\[^1\\]: Some users told us they’re seeing take-homes more recently, likely a function of worsening market conditions—the less leverage talent has, the more hoops companies can ask them to jump through.\\\\n\\[^2\\]: You might have to do this soon anyway, in all your interviews, to \\[ward off against AI-driven cheating\\](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-hard-is-it-to-cheat-with-chatgpt-in-technical-interviews).\\\\n\",\"excerpt\":\"We surveyed almost 700 of our users about their experiences with take-homes and interviewed a handful more for deeper insights.

          "content": "Footnotes Participating technical recruiters were paid a base rate and then received additional $$ for each accurate prediction. ↩ Different roles have different requirements. To correct for that, we asked each candidate to specify which eng role they were applying for: Software Engineer (back-end or full-stack), Mobile Engineer, Front-end Engineer, ML Engineer, Data Engineer, or Engineering Manager. Then we prompted recruiters to evaluate them specifically for that role. If no role was specified by the candidate, the default role to evaluate for was Software Engineer (back-end or full-stack). ↩ Top firms = Airbnb, Amazon, Anthropic, AWS, Apple, Asana, Atlassian, Bloomberg LP, Checkr, Coinbase, Coursera, Cruise, Dropbox, Etsy, Facebook, Flexport, GitHub, Google, Gusto, HashiCorp, Instacart, Instagram, Jane Street, Jump Trading, Khan Academy, LinkedIn, Lyft, Medium, Microsoft, Mozilla, Netflix, Oculus, OpenAI, Palantir, Peloton, Pinterest, Postmates, Quora, Reddit, Robinhood, Roblox, Salesforce, Segment, Slack, Snap, Snowflake, SpaceX, Spotify, Square, Stripe, Tesla, Thumbtack, TikTok, Twilio, Twitch, Twitter, Two Sigma, Uber, Udemy, Waymo, Whatsapp, Yelp, and Zoom. ↩ We corrected by FAANG & FAANG-adjacent experience (and all of our other variables) before making this statement, i.e., the effect existed for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds who did not have FAANG/FAANG-adjacent companies on their resumes. We expect that recruiters favor underrepresented minority candidates because of guidelines from their employers to focus on sourcing these types of candidates, as part of DEI initiatives. Discussion about the magnitude of this effect and its implications is out of scope of this piece. ↩ Interestingly, recruiters might penalize, for example, alternative education. Candidates with only alternative education pathways post-high school — coding bootcamps or digital certifications — appeared to be penalized by recruiters in this study. However, with limited observations (n=11), it’s inconclusive without further study. ↩ That field was optional, so most of the reasons recruiters provided were in cases when they said no — presumably because the reasons for saying yes may have seemed self-evident. ↩ It’s not that recruiters who generally take their time make more accurate judgements. Any recruiter slowing down might make them better at judging resumes! ↩ It’s important to stress that neither algorithm was custom-built. The models, one using a Random Forest algorithm and the other an XGBoost algorithm, are distinct but interrelated approaches akin to Decision Tree algorithms. Decision trees sort data into groups based on features. Random forest algorithms combine multiple decision trees to improve predictions. XGBoost builds multiple decision trees one after another, with each new tree focusing on prediction errors from the previous trees. ↩ Training data excluded data in this study. We take user privacy very seriously, and we want to stress that all models were local and anonymized and that no data in this study was shared with cloud LLMs. ↩ To see a particularly egregious example of recruiters favoring brands over substance, take a close look at this fake resume that got a bunch of recruiter responses. And this one too. ↩ We haven’t proven causality here, but when we just scoped our analysis to the same person, it appeared that taking more time did help (in other words, it’s not just that recruiters who spend more time usually are more accurate; it’s the added time). Still, this is something that merits more work, and we'll try to investigate it causally in the future. ↩",

          "title": "The unwritten rules (till now) of negotiating with Meta",
          "content": "Footnotes How team matching works changed fairly recently. In the past, you’d get an offer before you matched with a team and do a 6-week “bootcamp” where you’d get up to speed on Meta’s tech stack, infrastructure, and systems, followed by a multi-week “speed dating”-esque team matching cycle. Bootcamp still exists, but now it's much shorter (2-4 weeks), and the focus is getting new engineers ramped up on generic tools. After that, new engineers continue to ramp up on their specific teams. ↩ We’ve recently heard that Meta may now be insisting that team matching conversations happen in serial, i.e., you can only do one at a time. However, this doesn’t meaningfully change our advice. ↩ You might say, “Aline, why can’t I just make up offers?” We could never, in good conscience, advise that. It’s unethical, and though I’d argue that while Meta’s negotiation practices are also unethical, that’s not the way to win. Outside of ethical considerations, while the risks of getting caught are low, they’re not zero. Lying about offers, in our mind, is the last refuge of the incompetent. ↩ The advice in this post is orthogonal from your career goals and what you want to work on. This blog post is about navigating an unfair system filled with opaque rules while maximizing your cash. It is not about self-actualization, though we’d argue that creating the most optionality for yourself helps with self-actualization as well. You can also talk to smaller companies and use your big-co offers as leverage to increase your startup equity. There’s nothing wrong with that, but more detail on optionality and self-actualization is outside the scope of this post. ↩ Of course, some hiring managers will use high-pressure sales tactics or create false timelines to try to close you. But that’s the exception rather than the rule. You can decide if that’s something that you want to weigh when judging whether or not you want to work for them. ↩ We strongly urge you to avoid negotiating over the phone and over text, whenever possible. Your recruiter does 5 of these calls a day. You might do one of these calls every few years. Do the hard part over email. It’s the best way to level the playing field. Read this post to learn how to avoid synchronous phone negotiations (just look for “phone”). ↩ One advanced maneuver is to pit all your other companies against each other and raise up their initial offers BEFORE talking to Meta. We’ll likely write about how to run this play in a future post. ↩",

In two instances, the interviewee was familiar with the question and chose to solve the problem themselves. In one interview, the interviewee wanted to just try the question on their own and didn't prompt ChatGPT, ignoring our instructions. The last two interviews were \"custom\" interview questions that were problematic for reasons we’ll outline later in this article. ↩ This is a higher passthrough rate than you'd see in the wild.

But we’d like to brave the scathing mockery of the internets and try anyway!

Most people overestimated the number by an order of magnitude. Here's what we did to get to the actual number.Read more >You now need to do 15% better in technical interviews than you did at the start of 2022 (and the bar will keep rising).By Aline Lerner | Published: December 1, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024interviewing.io is a technical mock interview platform and technical recruiting marketplace, so we have a ton of useful data around technical interviewing and hiring. One of the most useful pieces of data in the current climate is the ever-changing technical interview bar – throughout 2022, it’s gotten progressively harder to pass technical interviews, and it’s only going to keep getting harder. We crunched the numbers and came up with a running index that quantifies where the eng bar will be, as a function of open tech jobs. The bar is clearly going up.Read more >How much have 2022 layoffs affected engineers vs. other departments? We dug into the data to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: October 13, 2022; Last updated: December 7, 2024Over the past few months, I’ve seen a number of fear-mongering pieces in the press about how the recession is driving tech layoffs and how tech employees (and engineers specifically) are losing their leverage as a result. The problem is that “tech” can mean anyone working at a tech company. You’re an engineer? Of course, you’re tech. You do ops? Great, you’re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn’t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It’s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that “tech” refers to engineers specifically. I don’t like imprecision, and I really don’t like fear-mongering. So, we at interviewing.io dug into the data to see if engineers do indeed have a reason to fear.Read more >The definitive list of companies who are hiring engineers right nowBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 20, 2022; Last updated: June 19, 2024interviewing.io is both a mock interview platform and an eng hiring marketplace (engineers use us for technical interview practice, and top performers get fast-tracked at companies), so we have some unique insights into how recent hiring freezes have affected engineers’ behavior. We also have unique insight into which companies are actually hiring. As such, in the spirit of being useful during a hard and uncertain time, we thought it’d be interesting to survey our users to see what’s actually going on in the market. TL;DR There are lots of engineers actively looking. There are also lots of companies who are actively hiring. Read the actual post to see the full list of 447 U.S. companies who are hiring software engineers right now.Read more >What’s actually going on with Google and Facebook hiring freezes? We surveyed 1000 engineers to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: August 1, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024It looks like we’re entering a recession. One of the hardest things about it is the lack of reliable information about whether companies are still hiring and what hiring freezes even mean. Arguably the two most impactful eng hiring freezes were announced by Facebook (May 4, 2022) and then Google (July 20, 2022). Facebook’s freeze is allegedly partial, targeting roles below L7 and excluding machine learning engineers. Google’s freeze is allegedly all-encompassing but may only last 2 weeks. But what’s actually going on?

Facebook’s freeze is allegedly partial, targeting roles below L7 and excluding machine learning engineers. Google’s freeze is allegedly all-encompassing but may only last 2 weeks.

We’ve seen the same practices with enough candidates, and across enough different titles and positions, that it’s become clear that they are not isolated incidents or a rogue recruiter’s doing but rather a consistent implementation of a deliberate strategy that comes from the top. If you’re negotiating with Meta, you need to know how they operate and understand the unwritten rules of the game. If you do not know the rules, you will fail — long before you even start negotiating.Read more >How to sabotage your salary negotiations efforts before you even startBy Aline Lerner | Published: August 23, 2023; Last updated: September 6, 2024At interviewing.io, we’ve coached hundreds of people through salary negotiation. We’re good at it — our average user gets $50k more in cash, and we have a 94% success rate. Having done this a lot, we’ve seen our users make the same two mistakes, over and over, BEFORE they start working with us. These mistakes are costly and make it harder for us to do our jobs. Both involve how you talk to recruiters at the start of your job search, way before there’s an offer. Even if you never use our service, you should absolutely avoid these mistakes.Read more >Exactly what to say when recruiters ask you to name the first number… and other negotiation word-for-wordsBy Aline Lerner | Published: August 16, 2018; Last updated: November 3, 2024There are a lot of resources out there that talk about salary negotiation but many tend to skew a bit theoretical. In my experience, one of the hardest things about negotiating your salary is knowing what to say in tough, ambiguous situations with a power balance that’s not in your favor. What’s OK? What’s rude? What are the social norms? And so on. Before I started interviewing.io, I’ve worked as a software engineer, an in-house recruiter, and an agency recruiter, so I’ve literally been on all sides of the negotiating table. For the last few years, I’ve been guest-lecturing MIT’s 6.UAT, a class about technical communication for computer science majors. Every semester, negotiation is one …Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

You can find them here. They include: The first seven chapters of the book, covering topics such as why technical interviews are broken, what recruiters won't tell you, why not to spend a lot of time on resumes, and how to get in the door at companies without a referral. Two technical chapters: Sliding Windows and Binary Search. Our new take on Binary Search teaches one template that works for every binary search problem on LeetCode, with only a single-line change you need to remember. The Sliding Windows chapter features 6 unique sliding window templates that make off-by-one errors a thing of the past.

The sequel is fittingly called Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. We cover everything you need to know for today's tougher technical interviews and hiring climate. We have (at least) thirteen new technical topics and over 150 new problems. We’ve also drawn on a decade of hiring data and 100k interviews from interviewing.io to help you get noticed, manage your job search, and negotiate the best possible offer. The book is available now, and purchases come with $50 off on interviewing.io... given that it costs ~$45, it's not a bad deal.Read more >Why we’re pausing our Pay Later ProgramBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 29, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023We recently made the difficult decision to pause our Pay Later Program. In this post, we’ll talk about why we made that call and what we’ll be doing instead to ensure that engineers who can’t afford to pay for practice will still be able to get it. We’ll also explain some things we’ve learned along the way about funnel optimization, some mistakes we made while iterating on this program, and what we’ll do differently when we hopefully unpause it in the future.Read more >Building interviewing.io's collaborative & replayable whiteboard, or making systems design interviews not suckBy Shehbaj Dhillon | Published: September 6, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023During the spring of 2022, I went from being a user of interviewing.io to being one of the engineers on the team.

Yes.

Today, we’re making good on that promise by launching our Pay Later Program! With this program, you get instant credits to spend on interview practice and then pay us once you’ve found a job.

This round of funding is a long time coming. I don’t know what the average company age is when successfully raising an A, but it took us 6 years to get here. It was a long and windy path, and for a little while, we almost died (more on that below), but we’re still here, and we’re so grateful and excited to finally have the resources to do what we’ve always wanted to do: fix hiring, for real. What does “fixing hiring” mean? We believe that the only way to really effect change, is to make …Read more >Announcing the interviewing.io Technical Interview Practice FellowshipBy Aline Lerner | Published: July 20, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io because I was frustrated with how inefficient and unfair hiring was and how much emphasis employers placed on resumes. But the problem is bigger than resumes. We’ve come to learn that interview practice matters just as much. The resume gets you in the door, and your interview performance is what gets you the offer. But, even though technical interviews are hard and scary for everyone — many of our users are senior engineers from FAANG who are terrified of getting back out there and code up the kinds of problems they don’t usually see at work while someone breathes down their neck — interview prep isn’t equitably distributed. This inequity never really …Read more >interviewing.io is finally out of beta. Anonymous technical interview practice for all!By Aline Lerner | Published: June 4, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io 5 years ago. After working as both an engineer and a recruiter, my frustration with how inefficient and unfair hiring had reached a boiling point. What made me especially angry was that despite mounting evidence that resumes are poor predictors of aptitude, employers were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously. In my mind, any great engineer, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to get their foot in the door wherever they choose. So, we set out to build a better system. On interviewing.io, software engineers can book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Facebook, Google, and others, and if …Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

Here's the data.By Mike Mroczka | Published: September 12, 2024; Last updated: September 13, 2024Have you ever wondered if you should spend more time on LeetCode, participate in those contests, or focus on solving harder problems? A popular Reddit post suggests you need 700+ questions and a LeetCode rating between 1800-2000 to pass FAANG interviews. Is this really what the data supports? To answer these questions and more, we looked at our users' LeetCode ranks and ratings and tied them back to interview performance on our platform and whether those users worked at FAANG. In this post, we’ll share what we’ve learned.Read more >Are recruiters better than a coin flip at judging resumes? Here's the data.By Aline Lerner and Peter Bergman | Published: May 1, 2024; Last updated: May 20, 2024In partnership with the team at Learning Collider, we ran a study to see how good recruiters were at judging resumes. We asked technical recruiters to review and make judgments about engineers’ resumes, just as they would in their current roles. They answered two questions per resume: Would you interview this candidate? What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview? We ended up with nearly 2,200 evaluations of over 1,000 resumes. We then compared those judgments to how those engineers performed in interviews on our platform. Here's what we learned.Read more >Refuting Bloomberg's analysis: ChatGPT isn't racist. But it is bad at recruiting.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 11, 2024; Last updated: April 17, 2024Bloomberg recently published an article saying ChatGPT has racial bias when evaluating resumes. We re-ran their numbers and saw that they didn't do any statistical significance testing. In other words, there's no evidence of racial bias, at least not in this data set. However, ChatGPT has another kind of bias -- it drastically overestimates the value of top companies and top schools and does non-traditional candidates a disservice as a result.Read more >Want to work from home? That’ll be $46,282.By Elliot Plant | Published: February 14, 2024Software engineering jobs come with a lot of perks. But that doesn’t mean our jobs are perfect. Work requires us to commute, reduces the time we can spend with family, increases our stress levels, and forces us to deal with teammates we don't gel with. And sometimes we work for companies with questionable morals and use technologies we don’t enjoy.  For some of us, it’s worth trading cash for a job that fits into our lives better. But how much cash? To figure this out, we surveyed our users about times they took jobs with lower compensation, why they did it, and how much money they left on the table. We have the numbers!Read more >How hard is it to cheat in technical interviews with ChatGPT? We ran an experiment.By Mike Mroczka | Published: January 31, 2024; Last updated: May 6, 2024Does ChatGPT make it easy to cheat in technical interviews? To find out, we ran an experiment where we instructed interviewees on our platform to use ChatGPT in their interviews, unbeknownst to their interviewers. The results were surprising, but as a preview, know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately.Read more >When is hiring coming back? Our predictions for 2024.By Aline Lerner | Published: December 11, 2023; Last updated: December 7, 2024Predictions are hard, and, inevitably, most of them turn out wrong. But we’d like to brave the scathing mockery of the internets and try anyway! Our courage is bolstered by some useful data we have (both proprietary and gathered from the internet), which we’ll use to guess what will happen in 2024 and to answer the question foremost in many of our minds: When is hiring coming back?Read more >Why AI can’t do hiringBy Aline Lerner | Published: May 16, 2023; Last updated: March 7, 2024The recent exciting and somewhat horrifying inflection point in AI capability tipped me into writing this blog post. I simply don't believe that AI can do hiring. My argument isn't about bias (though bias is a real problem) or that it's technologically impossible. It's just that the training data simply isn't available. Most people believe that if you can somehow combine what's available on LinkedIn, GitHub, and the social graph (who follows whom on Twitter etc.), you'll be able to find the good engineers who are actively looking and also figure out what they want. This is wrong. None of those 3 sources are actually useful. At the end of the day, you can’t use AI for hiring if you don’t have the data. And if you have the data, then you don’t strictly need AI.Read more >Does posting Open To Work on LinkedIn help or hurt? A tale of two labor markets.By Aline Lerner and Maxim Massenkoff | Published: April 11, 2023; Last updated: May 29, 2023If you’re a software engineer who’s on the market, should you list yourself as OpenToWork? Does doing so carry a negative signal? And with the recent deluge of layoffs at tech companies, has the meaning of OpenToWork changed? TL;DR It used to be bad. Now, it's not. Moreover, it's clear to us that the people who were laid off in the 2nd half of 2022 and 2023 so far are great... and that, by and large, these layoffs were indeed NOT based on performance.Read more >Why you shouldn’t list certifications on LinkedInBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 14, 2023; Last updated: May 16, 2023People often suggest that interviewing.io should create a certification that our users can post on their LinkedIn profile, e.g., something like “Top 10% performer on interviewing.io”. Presumably, these certifications would signal to recruiters that this person is a good engineer and worth reaching out to and should carry more signal than where said person went to school or worked previously. I've always thought certifications were a terrible idea, and I’ve resisted building them. Now, we've finally dug into the data to see if my hatred of them holds water. TL;DR it does.Read more >Our business depends on having the best interviewers, so we built an interviewer rating system. And you can too.By Aline Lerner | Published: January 18, 2023; Last updated: May 2, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you’re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world’s best companies. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. To keep our engineer customers happy, we have to make sure that our interviewers deliver value to them by conducting realistic mock interviews and giving useful, actionable feedback afterwards. To keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they’re getting without us. Otherwise, it’s just not worth it for them. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In this post, we’ll explain exactly how we compute and use these metrics to get the best work out of our interviewers.Read more >How much have 2022 layoffs affected engineers vs. other departments? We dug into the data to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: October 13, 2022; Last updated: December 7, 2024Over the past few months, I’ve seen a number of fear-mongering pieces in the press about how the recession is driving tech layoffs and how tech employees (and engineers specifically) are losing their leverage as a result. The problem is that “tech” can mean anyone working at a tech company. You’re an engineer? Of course, you’re tech. You do ops? Great, you’re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn’t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It’s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that “tech” refers to engineers specifically. I don’t like imprecision, and I really don’t like fear-mongering. So, we at interviewing.io dug into the data to see if engineers do indeed have a reason to fear.Read more >The definitive list of companies who are hiring engineers right nowBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 20, 2022; Last updated: June 19, 2024interviewing.io is both a mock interview platform and an eng hiring marketplace (engineers use us for technical interview practice, and top performers get fast-tracked at companies), so we have some unique insights into how recent hiring freezes have affected engineers’ behavior. We also have unique insight into which companies are actually hiring. As such, in the spirit of being useful during a hard and uncertain time, we thought it’d be interesting to survey our users to see what’s actually going on in the market. TL;DR There are lots of engineers actively looking. There are also lots of companies who are actively hiring. Read the actual post to see the full list of 447 U.S. companies who are hiring software engineers right now.Read more >Does communication matter in technical interviewing? We looked at 100K interviews to find out. By Dima Korolev | Published: May 18, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023The interviewing.io platform has hosted and collected feedback from over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity. But how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that talk is cheap. Read on to find out how and why.Read more >We analyzed 100K technical interviews to see where the best performers work. Here are the results.By Aline Lerner | Published: March 31, 2022; Last updated: March 28, 2024At interviewing.io, we’ve hosted over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. As it happens, we know where our users currently work – they tell us that when they sign up. Given that we have this data AND given that we know how well people do in their interviews, we thought it would be interesting to see which companies’ engineers are especially good at technical interviews. Our resulting top ten lists are in this post!Read more >The Eng Hiring Bar: What the hell is it?By Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 31, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023Recursive Cactus has been working as a full-stack engineer at a well-known tech company for the past 5 years, but he’s now considering a career move. Over the past 6 months, Recursive Cactus (that’s his anonymous handle on interviewing.io) has been preparing himself to succeed in future interviews, dedicating as much as 20-30 hours/week plowing through LeetCode exercises, digesting algorithms textbooks, and of course, practicing interviews on our platform to benchmark his progress. But this dedication to interview prep has been taking an emotional toll on him, ...Read more >No engineer has ever sued a company because of constructive post-interview feedback. So why don’t employers do it?By Aline Lerner | Published: February 6, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023One of the things that sucks most about technical interviews is that they’re a black box—candidates (usually) get told whether they made it to the next round, but they’re rarely told why they got the outcome that they did. Lack of feedback, or feedback that doesn’t come right away, isn’t just frustrating to candidates. It’s bad for business. We did a whole study on this. It turns out that candidates chronically underrate and overrate their technical interview performance, like so: Where this finding starts to get actionable is that there’s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they’d want to work with you. In other words, …Read more >We ran the numbers, and there really is a pipeline problem in eng hiring.By Aline Lerner | Published: December 3, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you say the words “there’s a pipeline problem” to explain why we’ve failed to make meaningful progress toward gender parity in software engineering, you probably won’t make many friends (or many hires). The pipeline problem argument goes something like this: “There aren’t enough qualified women out there, so it’s not our fault if we don’t hire them.” Many people don’t like this reductive line of thinking because it ignores the growing body of research that points to unwelcoming environments that drive underrepresented talent out of tech: STEM in early education being unfriendly to children from underrepresented backgrounds, lack of a level playing field and unequal access to quality STEM education (see this study on …Read more >You probably don’t factor in engineering time when calculating cost per hire. Here’s why you really should.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 24, 2019; Last updated: September 18, 2023Whether you’re a recruiter yourself or an engineer who’s involved in hiring, you’ve probably heard of the following two recruiting-related metrics: time to hire and cost per hire. Indeed, these are THE two metrics that any self-respecting recruiting team will track. Time to hire is important because it lets you plan — if a given role has historically taken 3 months to fill, you’re going to act differently when you need to fill it again than if it takes 2 weeks. And, traditionally, cost per hire has been a planning tool as well — if you’re setting recruiting budgets for next year and have a headcount in mind, seeing what recruiting spent last year is …Read more >Can fake names create bias? An exploration into interviewing.io’s pseudonym generatorBy Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 7, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023Hello everyone, my name is Atomic Artichoke, and I’m the newest employee of the interviewing.io team, having joined a couple months ago as a Data Scientist. Atomic Artichoke isn’t my real name, of course. That’s the pseudonym the interviewing.io platform gave me, right before I took my final interview with the company. If you’ve never used interviewing.io before (and hey, if you haven’t already, why not sign up now?), it’s a platform where you can practice technical interviewing anonymously with experienced engineers (and do real job interviews anonymously too). When it’s time to interview, you and your partner meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard (check out recordings of …Read more >There is a real connection between technical interview performance and salary. Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 26, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023At the end of the day, money is a huge driver for the decisions we make about what jobs to go after. In the past, we’ve written about how to negotiate your salary, and there are a lot of labor statistics and reports out there looking at salaries in the tech industry as a whole. But as with many things in eng hiring, there’s very little concrete data on whether technical interview performance plays a role in compensation offers. So we set out to gather the data and asked our users who had gone on to successfully get jobs after using our platform to share their salary info. With our unique dataset of real coding …Read more >Impostor syndrome strikes men just as hard as women... and other findings from thousands of technical interviewsBy Aline Lerner | Published: October 30, 2018; Last updated: May 2, 2023The modern technical interview is a rite of passage for software engineers and (hopefully!) the precursor to a great job. But it’s also a huge source of stress and endless questions for new candidates. Just searching “how do I prepare for a technical interview” turns up millions of Medium posts, coding bootcamp blogs, Quora discussions, and entire books. Despite all this conversation, people struggle to know how they’re even doing in interviews. In a previous post, we found that a surprisingly large number of interviewing.io’s users consistently underestimate their performance, making them more likely to drop out of the process and ultimately harder to hire. Now, and with considerably more data (over 10k interviews led …Read more >We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered. It didn't.By Samantha Jordan | Published: February 13, 2018; Last updated: October 1, 2023interviewing.io is a platform where engineers practice technical interviewing anonymously. If things go well, they can unlock the ability to participate in real, still anonymous, interviews with top companies like Twitch, Lyft and more. Earlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students, with the intent of helping level the playing field right at the start of people’s careers. The sad truth is that with the state of college recruiting today, if you don’t attend one of very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim. It’s not fair, and it sucks, but university recruiting is still dominated by career fairs. Companies pragmatically choose to visit the same …Read more >What do the best interviewers have in common? We looked at thousands of real interviews to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 29, 2017; Last updated: July 14, 2023At interviewing.io, we’ve analyzed and written at some depth about what makes for a good interview from the perspective of an interviewee. However, despite the inherent power imbalance, interviewing is a two-way street. I wrote a while ago about how, in this market, recruiting isn’t about vetting as much as it is about selling, and not engaging candidates in the course of talking to them for an hour is a woefully missed opportunity. But, just like solving interview questions is a learned skill that takes time and practice, so, too, is the other side of the table. Being a good interviewer takes time and effort and a fundamental willingness to get out of autopilot and …Read more >We analyzed thousands of technical interviews on everything from language to code style.

Maybe you’re a college student or fresh grad who is going through the interviewing process for the first time. Maybe you’re an experienced software engineer who hasn’t even thought about interviews for a few years. Either way, the first step in the interviewing process ...Read more >LinkedIn endorsements are dumb. Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 27, 2017; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you’re an engineer who’s been endorsed on LinkedIn for any number of languages/frameworks/skills, you’ve probably noticed that something isn’t quite right. Maybe they’re frameworks you’ve never touched or languages you haven’t used since freshman year of college. No matter the specifics, you’re probably at least a bit wary of the value of the LinkedIn endorsements feature. The internets, too, don’t disappoint in enumerating some absurd potential endorsements or in bemoaning the lack of relevance of said endorsements, even when they’re given in earnest. Having a gut feeling for this is one thing, but we were curious about whether we could actually come up with some numbers that showed how useless endorsements can be, and …Read more >Lessons from 3,000 technical interviews… or how what you do after graduation matters way more than where you went to schoolBy Aline Lerner | Published: December 28, 2016; Last updated: May 2, 2023The first blog post I published that got any real attention was called “Lessons from a year’s worth of hiring data“. It was my attempt to understand what attributes of someone’s resume actually mattered for getting a software engineering job. Surprisingly, as it turned out, where someone went to school didn’t matter at all, and by far and away, the strongest signal came from the number of typos and grammatical errors on their resume. Since then, I’ve discovered (and written about) how useless resumes are, but ever since writing that first post, I’ve been itching to do something similar with interviewing.io’s data. For context, interviewing.io is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously …Read more >After a lot more data, technical interview performance really is kind of arbitrary.By Aline Lerner | Published: October 13, 2016; Last updated: March 28, 2024interviewing.io is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously, and if things go well, get jobs at top companies in the process. We started it because resumes suck and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle. In February of 2016, we published a post about how people’s technical interview performance, from interview to interview, seemed quite volatile. At the time, we just had a few hundred interviews to draw on, so as you can imagine, we were quite eager to rerun the numbers with the advent of more data. After drawing on over a thousand interviews, the numbers hold up. In …Read more >People are still bad at gauging their own interview performance.

In the past few months, we’ve amassed over 600 technical interviews along with their associated data and metadata. Interview questions tend to fall into the category of what you’d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role at a top company, and interviewers typically come from a mix of larger companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as engineering-focused startups like Asana, Mattermark, KeepSafe, and more.

To keep our engineer customers happy, we have to make sure that our interviewers deliver value to them by conducting realistic mock interviews and giving useful, actionable feedback afterwards. To keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they’re getting without us. Otherwise, it’s just not worth it for them.\\\\n\\\\nThis means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. \\\\n\\\\nIn this post, we’ll explain exactly how we compute and use these metrics to get the best work out of our interviewers.\\\\n\",\"image\":{\"data\":{\"id\":599,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"featured\\_image (1).png\",\"alternativeText\":\"Line graph showing interviewers improving over time\",\"caption\":null,\"width\":1200,\"height\":630,\"formats\":{\"large\":{\"ext\":\".png\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/large\\_featured\\_image\\_1\\_6652c3f166.png\",\"hash\":\"large\\_featured\\_image\\_1\\_6652c3f166\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"name\":\"large\\_featured\\_image (1).png\",\"path\":null,\"size\":60.36,\"width\":1000,\"height\":525},\"small\":{\"ext\":\".png\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/small\\_featured\\_image\\_1\\_6652c3f166.png\",\"hash\":\"small\\_featured\\_image\\_1\\_6652c3f166\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"name\":\"small\\_featured\\_image (1).png\",\"path\":null,\"size\":22.97,\"width\":500,\"height\":263},\"medium\":{\"ext\":\".png\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/medium\\_featured\\_image\\_1\\_6652c3f166.png\",\"hash\":\"medium\\_featured\\_image\\_1\\_6652c3f166\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"name\":\"medium\\_featured\\_image (1).png\",\"path\":null,\"size\":38.89,\"width\":750,\"height\":394},\"thumbnail\":{\"ext\":\".png\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail\\_featured\\_image\\_1\\_6652c3f166.png\",\"hash\":\"thumbnail\\_featured\\_image\\_1\\_6652c3f166\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"name\":\"thumbnail\\_featured\\_image (1).png\",\"path\":null,\"size\":8.48,\"width\":245,\"height\":129}},\"hash\":\"featured\\_image\\_1\\_6652c3f166\",\"ext\":\".png\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"size\":44.15,\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/featured\\_image\\_1\\_6652c3f166.png\",\"previewUrl\":null,\"provider\":\"aws-s3\",\"provider\\_metadata\":null,\"createdAt\":\"2023-01-13T23:20:51.520Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-08-23T16:24:46.620Z\"}}},\"category\":{\"data\":\\[{\"id\":1,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Data deep dives\",\"slug\":\"data-deep-dives\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-09-27T16:59:29.755Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-05-04T00:41:57.214Z\"}},{\"id\":5,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"For employers/How to hire better\",\"slug\":\"for-employers-how-to-hire-better\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-12-12T19:28:37.748Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-05-04T00:42:11.494Z\"}}\\]},\"authors\":{\"data\":\\[{\"id\":1,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Aline Lerner\",\"email\":\"aline@interviewing.io\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-09-27T16:58:49.743Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2022-09-27T16:58:49.743Z\",\"description\":null,\"tag\\_line\":null}}\\]},\"blogPostSEO\":{\"id\":87,\"metaTitle\":\"We built an interviewer rating system.\",\"metaDescription\":\"Our business depends on having the best interviewers, so we started tracking two metrics that made our interviewers way better.\",\"keywords\":null,\"metaRobots\":null,\"structuredData\":null,\"metaViewport\":null,\"canonicalURL\":null}}},{\"id\":13,\"attributes\":{\"publicationDate\":\"2022-10-13\",\"title\":\"How much have 2022 layoffs affected engineers vs. other departments?

At interviewing.io, my team and I have been trying to make hiring meritocratic for the last decade. I’ll also be the first to admit that DEI is ideologically flawed because of its emphasis on race and gender-based outcomes and its insistence on equality of those outcomes. In the last decade, we've seen a lot of bad stuff done in the name of DEI, firsthand. I'll talk about those in this post. But all the recent pro-meritocracy, anti-DEI rhetoric is bad. Yelling “Meritocracy!” as if it’s a fait accompli is just as harmful as the worst parts of DEI. I’d even go so far to say that the DEI movement has done more for meritocracy than the loud pro-meritocracy movement is doing right now. I’m delighted that “meritocracy” is no longer a dirty word. But, just saying it isn’t enough. We have to change our hiring practices. We need to stop using meritocracy as a shield to preserve the status quo. In this post, I talk about the flaws of DEI, the false promise of meritocracy, and what to do to actually make hiring meritocratic and fair.Read more >Refuting Bloomberg's analysis: ChatGPT isn't racist. But it is bad at recruiting.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 11, 2024; Last updated: April 17, 2024Bloomberg recently published an article saying ChatGPT has racial bias when evaluating resumes. We re-ran their numbers and saw that they didn't do any statistical significance testing. In other words, there's no evidence of racial bias, at least not in this data set. However, ChatGPT has another kind of bias -- it drastically overestimates the value of top companies and top schools and does non-traditional candidates a disservice as a result.Read more >The 3 things that diversity hiring initiatives get wrongBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 18, 2021; Last updated: June 19, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade.

We’ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs. For the last year or so, we’ve also been running a Fellowship program specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds.

But the problem is bigger than resumes. We’ve come to learn that interview practice matters just as much. The resume gets you in the door, and your interview performance is what gets you the offer. But, even though technical interviews are hard and scary for everyone — many of our users are senior engineers from FAANG who are terrified of getting back out there and code up the kinds of problems they don’t usually see at work while someone breathes down their neck — interview prep isn’t equitably distributed. This inequity never really …Read more >We ran the numbers, and there really is a pipeline problem in eng hiring.By Aline Lerner | Published: December 3, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you say the words “there’s a pipeline problem” to explain why we’ve failed to make meaningful progress toward gender parity in software engineering, you probably won’t make many friends (or many hires). The pipeline problem argument goes something like this: “There aren’t enough qualified women out there, so it’s not our fault if we don’t hire them.” Many people don’t like this reductive line of thinking because it ignores the growing body of research that points to unwelcoming environments that drive underrepresented talent out of tech: STEM in early education being unfriendly to children from underrepresented backgrounds, lack of a level playing field and unequal access to quality STEM education (see this study on …Read more >Can fake names create bias?

Atomic Artichoke isn’t my real name, of course. That’s the pseudonym the interviewing.io platform gave me, right before I took my final interview with the company.

If things go well, they can unlock the ability to participate in real, still anonymous, interviews with top companies like Twitch, Lyft and more. Earlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students, with the intent of helping level the playing field right at the start of people’s careers. The sad truth is that with the state of college recruiting today, if you don’t attend one of very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim. It’s not fair, and it sucks, but university recruiting is still dominated by career fairs. Companies pragmatically choose to visit the same …Read more >If you care about diversity, don't just hire from the same five schoolsBy Meena Boppana | Published: October 24, 2017; Last updated: June 20, 2023EDIT: Our university hiring platform is now on Product Hunt! If you’re a software engineer, you probably believe that, despite some glitches here and there, folks who have the technical chops can get hired as software engineers. We regularly hear stories about college dropouts, who, through hard work and sheer determination, bootstrapped themselves into millionaires. These stories appeal to our sense of wonder and our desire for fairness in the world, but the reality is very different. For many students looking for their first job, the odds of breaking into a top company are slim because they will likely never even have the chance to show their skills in an interview. For these students ...Read more >You can’t fix diversity in tech without fixing the technical interview.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 22, 2016; Last updated: July 15, 2023In the last few months, several large players, including Google and Facebook, have released their latest and ultimately disappointing diversity numbers. Even with increased effort and resources poured into diversity hiring programs, Facebook’s headcount for women and people of color hasn’t really increased in the past 3 years. Google’s numbers have looked remarkably similar, and both players have yet to make significant impact in the space, despite a number of initiatives spanning everything from a points system rewarding recruiters for bringing in candidates from diverse backgrounds, to increased funding for tech education, to efforts to hire more candidates from diverse backgrounds in key leadership positions.

Here's the data.By Mike Mroczka | Published: September 12, 2024; Last updated: September 13, 2024Have you ever wondered if you should spend more time on LeetCode, participate in those contests, or focus on solving harder problems? A popular Reddit post suggests you need 700+ questions and a LeetCode rating between 1800-2000 to pass FAANG interviews. Is this really what the data supports? To answer these questions and more, we looked at our users' LeetCode ranks and ratings and tied them back to interview performance on our platform and whether those users worked at FAANG. In this post, we’ll share what we’ve learned.Read more >The other half, or why interviewers aren't always great and how to make them betterBy Jos Visser | Published: June 11, 2024It is high time we start talking about interviewing. I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about the other half? What about the interviewer? In the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. This stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the interviewer. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews. Maybe they have even done a few interviews! Consequently, there is a lot of bad interviewing being done. That needs to change.Read more >My manager is not promoting me. What should I do?

That’ll be $46,282.By Elliot Plant | Published: February 14, 2024Software engineering jobs come with a lot of perks. But that doesn’t mean our jobs are perfect. Work requires us to commute, reduces the time we can spend with family, increases our stress levels, and forces us to deal with teammates we don't gel with. And sometimes we work for companies with questionable morals and use technologies we don’t enjoy.  For some of us, it’s worth trading cash for a job that fits into our lives better. But how much cash? To figure this out, we surveyed our users about times they took jobs with lower compensation, why they did it, and how much money they left on the table. We have the numbers!Read more >How hard is it to cheat in technical interviews with ChatGPT?

The results were surprising, but as a preview, know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately.Read more >How software engineering behavioral interviews are evaluated at Meta (from an ex-Meta manager)By Lior Neu-ner | Published: February 14, 2023; Last updated: April 28, 2025Hi, I’m Lior.

We looked at 100K interviews to find out. By Dima Korolev | Published: May 18, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023The interviewing.io platform has hosted and collected feedback from over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity. But how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that talk is cheap. Read on to find out how and why.Read more >Hamtips, or why I still run the Technical Phone Screen as the Hiring ManagerBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: October 6, 2021; Last updated: May 2, 2023“Hamtips” stands for “Hiring Manager Technical Phone Screen.” This combines two calls: the Technical Phone Screen (TPS), which is a coding exercise that usually happens before the onsite, and the HMS call, which is a call with the Hiring Manager. By combining these two steps you shorten the intro-to-offer by ~1 week and reduce candidate dropoff by 5-10%. It’s also a lot less work for recruiters playing scheduling battleship. Finally, Hiring Managers will, on average, be better at selling working at the company – it’s kind of their job.Read more >Technical phone screen superforecastersBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: November 25, 2020; Last updated: July 14, 2023“The new VP wants us to double engineering’s headcount in the next six months. If we have a chance in hell to hit the hiring target, you seriously need to reconsider how fussy you’ve become.” It’s never good to have a recruiter ask engineers to lower their hiring bar, but he had a point. It can take upwards of 100 engineering hours to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire. Visnu and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the onsite pass rate went back up, and interviewing burnout receded. We didn’t lower the hiring bar, though. There was a better way.Read more >I’ve conducted over 600 technical interviews on interviewing.io.

I’d like to share lessons learned, why I approach interviews the way that I do, and shed some light on common problem areas I see happen in technical interviews.

Sometime between January and February 2020, I wanted to change jobs and was looking to join a new company. This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews – 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. Doing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

Doing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.\",\"image\":{\"data\":{\"id\":299,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"539938699-huge.webp\",\"alternativeText\":\"539938699-huge.webp\",\"caption\":\"539938699-huge.webp\",\"width\":6016,\"height\":4016,\"formats\":{\"large\":{\"ext\":\".webp\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/large\\_539938699\\_huge\\_799b2437e1.webp\",\"hash\":\"large\\_539938699\\_huge\\_799b2437e1\",\"mime\":\"image/webp\",\"name\":\"large\\_539938699-huge.webp\",\"path\":null,\"size\":32.09,\"width\":1000,\"height\":668},\"small\":{\"ext\":\".webp\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/small\\_539938699\\_huge\\_799b2437e1.webp\",\"hash\":\"small\\_539938699\\_huge\\_799b2437e1\",\"mime\":\"image/webp\",\"name\":\"small\\_539938699-huge.webp\",\"path\":null,\"size\":13.84,\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"medium\":{\"ext\":\".webp\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/medium\\_539938699\\_huge\\_799b2437e1.webp\",\"hash\":\"medium\\_539938699\\_huge\\_799b2437e1\",\"mime\":\"image/webp\",\"name\":\"medium\\_539938699-huge.webp\",\"path\":null,\"size\":22.45,\"width\":750,\"height\":501},\"thumbnail\":{\"ext\":\".webp\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail\\_539938699\\_huge\\_799b2437e1.webp\",\"hash\":\"thumbnail\\_539938699\\_huge\\_799b2437e1\",\"mime\":\"image/webp\",\"name\":\"thumbnail\\_539938699-huge.webp\",\"path\":null,\"size\":5.4,\"width\":234,\"height\":156}},\"hash\":\"539938699\\_huge\\_799b2437e1\",\"ext\":\".webp\",\"mime\":\"image/webp\",\"size\":407.91,\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/539938699\\_huge\\_799b2437e1.webp\",\"previewUrl\":null,\"provider\":\"aws-s3\",\"provider\\_metadata\":null,\"createdAt\":\"2022-12-07T15:31:23.508Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2022-12-07T15:31:23.508Z\"}}},\"category\":{\"data\":\\[{\"id\":8,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Interview tips\",\"slug\":\"interview-tips\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-12-12T19:40:07.430Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-05-04T00:42:50.598Z\"}},{\"id\":6,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Guest posts\",\"slug\":\"guest-posts\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-12-12T19:29:31.811Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-05-04T00:42:23.284Z\"}}\\]},\"authors\":{\"data\":\\[{\"id\":5,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Uduak Obong-Eren\",\"email\":null,\"createdAt\":\"2022-11-21T19:20:19.137Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-04-19T22:16:53.938Z\",\"description\":\"Uduak Obong-Eren is a Software Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area who is passionate about architecting and building scalable software systems.

At interviewing.io, my team and I have been trying to make hiring meritocratic for the last decade. I’ll also be the first to admit that DEI is ideologically flawed because of its emphasis on race and gender-based outcomes and its insistence on equality of those outcomes. In the last decade, we've seen a lot of bad stuff done in the name of DEI, firsthand. I'll talk about those in this post. But all the recent pro-meritocracy, anti-DEI rhetoric is bad. Yelling “Meritocracy!” as if it’s a fait accompli is just as harmful as the worst parts of DEI. I’d even go so far to say that the DEI movement has done more for meritocracy than the loud pro-meritocracy movement is doing right now. I’m delighted that “meritocracy” is no longer a dirty word. But, just saying it isn’t enough. We have to change our hiring practices. We need to stop using meritocracy as a shield to preserve the status quo. In this post, I talk about the flaws of DEI, the false promise of meritocracy, and what to do to actually make hiring meritocratic and fair.Read more >Are recruiters better than a coin flip at judging resumes? Here's the data.By Aline Lerner and Peter Bergman | Published: May 1, 2024; Last updated: May 20, 2024In partnership with the team at Learning Collider, we ran a study to see how good recruiters were at judging resumes. We asked technical recruiters to review and make judgments about engineers’ resumes, just as they would in their current roles. They answered two questions per resume: Would you interview this candidate? What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview? We ended up with nearly 2,200 evaluations of over 1,000 resumes. We then compared those judgments to how those engineers performed in interviews on our platform. Here's what we learned.Read more >How hard is it to cheat in technical interviews with ChatGPT? We ran an experiment.By Mike Mroczka | Published: January 31, 2024; Last updated: May 6, 2024Does ChatGPT make it easy to cheat in technical interviews? To find out, we ran an experiment where we instructed interviewees on our platform to use ChatGPT in their interviews, unbeknownst to their interviewers. The results were surprising, but as a preview, know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately.Read more >The 3 things that diversity hiring initiatives get wrongBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 18, 2021; Last updated: June 19, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade. Five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies. We’ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs. For the last year or so, we’ve also been running a Fellowship program specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds. That’s all to say that even though I have developed some strong opinions about “diversity hiring” initiatives, my opinions are based not on anecdotes but on cold, hard data. And the data points …Read more >The technical interview practice gap, and how it keeps underrepresented groups out of software engineeringBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 9, 2021; Last updated: May 24, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade, and five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies.

Anonymous technical interview practice for all!By Aline Lerner | Published: June 4, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io 5 years ago. After working as both an engineer and a recruiter, my frustration with how inefficient and unfair hiring had reached a boiling point. What made me especially angry was that despite mounting evidence that resumes are poor predictors of aptitude, employers were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously. In my mind, any great engineer, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to get their foot in the door wherever they choose. So, we set out to build a better system. On interviewing.io, software engineers can book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Facebook, Google, and others, and if …Read more >The Eng Hiring Bar: What the hell is it?By Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 31, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023Recursive Cactus has been working as a full-stack engineer at a well-known tech company for the past 5 years, but he’s now considering a career move. Over the past 6 months, Recursive Cactus (that’s his anonymous handle on interviewing.io) has been preparing himself to succeed in future interviews, dedicating as much as 20-30 hours/week plowing through LeetCode exercises, digesting algorithms textbooks, and of course, practicing interviews on our platform to benchmark his progress. But this dedication to interview prep has been taking an emotional toll on him, ...Read more >No engineer has ever sued a company because of constructive post-interview feedback. So why don’t employers do it?By Aline Lerner | Published: February 6, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023One of the things that sucks most about technical interviews is that they’re a black box—candidates (usually) get told whether they made it to the next round, but they’re rarely told why they got the outcome that they did. Lack of feedback, or feedback that doesn’t come right away, isn’t just frustrating to candidates. It’s bad for business. We did a whole study on this. It turns out that candidates chronically underrate and overrate their technical interview performance, like so: Where this finding starts to get actionable is that there’s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they’d want to work with you. In other words, …Read more >We ran the numbers, and there really is a pipeline problem in eng hiring.By Aline Lerner | Published: December 3, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you say the words “there’s a pipeline problem” to explain why we’ve failed to make meaningful progress toward gender parity in software engineering, you probably won’t make many friends (or many hires). The pipeline problem argument goes something like this: “There aren’t enough qualified women out there, so it’s not our fault if we don’t hire them.” Many people don’t like this reductive line of thinking because it ignores the growing body of research that points to unwelcoming environments that drive underrepresented talent out of tech: STEM in early education being unfriendly to children from underrepresented backgrounds, lack of a level playing field and unequal access to quality STEM education (see this study on …Read more >We looked at how a thousand college students performed in technical interviews to see if where they went to school mattered. It didn't.By Samantha Jordan | Published: February 13, 2018; Last updated: October 1, 2023interviewing.io is a platform where engineers practice technical interviewing anonymously. If things go well, they can unlock the ability to participate in real, still anonymous, interviews with top companies like Twitch, Lyft and more. Earlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students, with the intent of helping level the playing field right at the start of people’s careers. The sad truth is that with the state of college recruiting today, if you don’t attend one of very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim. It’s not fair, and it sucks, but university recruiting is still dominated by career fairs. Companies pragmatically choose to visit the same …Read more >If you care about diversity, don't just hire from the same five schoolsBy Meena Boppana | Published: October 24, 2017; Last updated: June 20, 2023EDIT: Our university hiring platform is now on Product Hunt! If you’re a software engineer, you probably believe that, despite some glitches here and there, folks who have the technical chops can get hired as software engineers. We regularly hear stories about college dropouts, who, through hard work and sheer determination, bootstrapped themselves into millionaires. These stories appeal to our sense of wonder and our desire for fairness in the world, but the reality is very different. For many students looking for their first job, the odds of breaking into a top company are slim because they will likely never even have the chance to show their skills in an interview. For these students ...Read more >LinkedIn endorsements are dumb. Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 27, 2017; Last updated: May 2, 2023If you’re an engineer who’s been endorsed on LinkedIn for any number of languages/frameworks/skills, you’ve probably noticed that something isn’t quite right. Maybe they’re frameworks you’ve never touched or languages you haven’t used since freshman year of college. No matter the specifics, you’re probably at least a bit wary of the value of the LinkedIn endorsements feature. The internets, too, don’t disappoint in enumerating some absurd potential endorsements or in bemoaning the lack of relevance of said endorsements, even when they’re given in earnest. Having a gut feeling for this is one thing, but we were curious about whether we could actually come up with some numbers that showed how useless endorsements can be, and …Read more >You can’t fix diversity in tech without fixing the technical interview.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 22, 2016; Last updated: July 15, 2023In the last few months, several large players, including Google and Facebook, have released their latest and ultimately disappointing diversity numbers. Even with increased effort and resources poured into diversity hiring programs, Facebook’s headcount for women and people of color hasn’t really increased in the past 3 years. Google’s numbers have looked remarkably similar, and both players have yet to make significant impact in the space, despite a number of initiatives spanning everything from a points system rewarding recruiters for bringing in candidates from diverse backgrounds, to increased funding for tech education, to efforts to hire more candidates from diverse backgrounds in key leadership positions. Why have gains in diversity hiring been so lackluster across …Read more >Resumes suck. Here's the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 11, 2014; Last updated: April 10, 2024About a year ago, after looking at the resumes of engineers we had interviewed at TrialPay in 2012, I learned that the strongest signal for whether someone would get an offer was the number of typos and grammatical errors on their resume. On the other hand, where people went to school, their GPA, and highest degree earned didn’t matter at all.

It’s a classic, and the main point is that good design should make everything painfully obvious to users without demanding anything of them. Resumes are just the same. Your resume shouldn’t make recruiters think. It should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less. We've said before that spending a lot of time on your resume is a fool's errand, but if you’re going to do something to it, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Here's exactly what to do.Read more >Why resume writing is snake oilBy Aline Lerner | Published: April 2, 2025A lot of other platforms offer resume reviews or help with writing resumes for $$. We don't do it, despite a lot of our users asking for this feature. The reason I've refused to build them is because, simply put, resume writing is snake oil. Why? Because recruiters aren't reading resumes. If you don't have top brands, better wording won't help. If you do have top brands, the wording doesn't matter.Read more >It's OK to postpone your interviews if you're not readyBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 25, 2025; Last updated: April 28, 2025At interviewing.io, we’ve seen hundreds of thousands of engineers go through job searches, and the biggest mistakes we see people make are all variations on the same theme: not postponing their interview when they aren’t ready. In most situations, there is no downside to postponing. In this post, we'll tell you what to do and say.Read more >How well do LeetCode ratings predict interview performance? Here's the data.By Mike Mroczka | Published: September 12, 2024; Last updated: September 13, 2024Have you ever wondered if you should spend more time on LeetCode, participate in those contests, or focus on solving harder problems? A popular Reddit post suggests you need 700+ questions and a LeetCode rating between 1800-2000 to pass FAANG interviews. Is this really what the data supports? To answer these questions and more, we looked at our users' LeetCode ranks and ratings and tied them back to interview performance on our platform and whether those users worked at FAANG. In this post, we’ll share what we’ve learned.Read more >How to get in the door at top companies: cold outreach to hiring managers. Part 2 of 2.By Aline Lerner | Published: July 31, 2024; Last updated: November 3, 2024In part 1 of this post, we analyzed different ways to get into companies along two axes: effectiveness and how much control you actually have. The channel that maximizes both effectiveness and control is cold outreach to hiring managers (not recruiters!). And yet, most people do this type of outreach incorrectly. In this post, we'll tell you exactly what to do and what to say to reach out to hiring managers at top companies and get responses.Read more >How to get in the door at top companies: a data-driven, practical guide for software engineers. Part 1.By Aline Lerner | Published: July 24, 2024; Last updated: October 28, 2024interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform — we help engineers prepare for technical interviews. In this market, many of our users are struggling with getting in the door at companies, so we ran a survey to see what’s worked well and what hasn’t, in today’s difficult climate. Not surprisingly, warm referrals are the best way in. On the other hand, agency recruiters are clearly the worst. But not all channels are created equal. Some, like recruiters contacting you, you have minimal control over, and whether you get contacted is largely a function of whether you have top brands on your resume or belong to an underrepresented group. With others, like reaching out to hiring managers, you are fully in control of your destiny. Here's how to make the most of a difficult landscape.Read more >I’ve never written code, but I just passed a Google system design interview.By Kevin Landucci | Published: August 10, 2023; Last updated: August 31, 2023My name is Kevin. I am not and have never been a software engineer. I have never written or tested a single line of code, and I have never even worked as a PM. Despite that, I was able to pass a Google system design interview. I had just finished working on a system design interview guide and learned a LOT from doing that, but I also learned a few tricks along the way. If these tricks helped me pass, then imagine what you’ll be able to do with them.Read more >How software engineering behavioral interviews are evaluated at Meta (from an ex-Meta manager)By Lior Neu-ner | Published: February 14, 2023; Last updated: April 28, 2025Hi, I’m Lior.

We looked at 100K interviews to find out. By Dima Korolev | Published: May 18, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023The interviewing.io platform has hosted and collected feedback from over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity. But how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that talk is cheap. Read on to find out how and why.Read more >We analyzed 100K technical interviews to see where the best performers work. Here are the results.By Aline Lerner | Published: March 31, 2022; Last updated: March 28, 2024At interviewing.io, we’ve hosted over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. As it happens, we know where our users currently work – they tell us that when they sign up. Given that we have this data AND given that we know how well people do in their interviews, we thought it would be interesting to see which companies’ engineers are especially good at technical interviews. Our resulting top ten lists are in this post!Read more >How do I know if I’m ready to interview at FAANG?By Atomic Artichoke | Published: December 3, 2020; Last updated: June 19, 2024Recently, someone asked us how you know you’re ready to succeed in a Facebook/Amazon/Apple/Netflix/Google (FAANG) interview. It’s an interesting question, and one I’m sure many of you job seekers out there are wondering. Internally, we have our own beliefs, but we wanted to see if we could answer this question more objectively. So we set off on a journey to acquire data to try answering it.Read more >I’ve conducted over 600 technical interviews on interviewing.io.

I’d like to share lessons learned, why I approach interviews the way that I do, and shed some light on common problem areas I see happen in technical interviews.

Sometime between January and February 2020, I wanted to change jobs and was looking to join a new company. This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews – 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. Doing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

We learned a lot—mostly about candidates' poor experiences and negative feelings toward take-homes. They take a lot of time. They don’t respect candidates’ time. Candidates often get no feedback. And candidates are almost never compensated. Really, it's all about value asymmetry. The good news? Turns out there are some pretty simple things companies can do to vastly improve their take-home assignmentsRead more >The other half, or why interviewers aren't always great and how to make them betterBy Jos Visser | Published: June 11, 2024It is high time we start talking about interviewing. I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about the other half? What about the interviewer? In the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. This stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the interviewer. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews. Maybe they have even done a few interviews! Consequently, there is a lot of bad interviewing being done. That needs to change.Read more >Why AI can’t do hiringBy Aline Lerner | Published: May 16, 2023; Last updated: March 7, 2024The recent exciting and somewhat horrifying inflection point in AI capability tipped me into writing this blog post. I simply don't believe that AI can do hiring. My argument isn't about bias (though bias is a real problem) or that it's technologically impossible. It's just that the training data simply isn't available. Most people believe that if you can somehow combine what's available on LinkedIn, GitHub, and the social graph (who follows whom on Twitter etc.), you'll be able to find the good engineers who are actively looking and also figure out what they want. This is wrong. None of those 3 sources are actually useful. At the end of the day, you can’t use AI for hiring if you don’t have the data. And if you have the data, then you don’t strictly need AI.Read more >We have the best technical interviewers on the market. Here's how we do it.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 28, 2023; Last updated: August 27, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers in a way that no single employer does – if we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In a recent post, we shared how, over time, we came up with two metrics that, together, tell a complete and compelling story about interviewer quality: the candidate experience metric and the calibration metric. In this post, we’ll talk about how to apply our learnings about interviewer quality to your own process. We’ve made a bunch of mistakes so you don’t have to! It boils down to choosing the right people, tracking those 2 metrics diligently, rewarding good behavior, and committing to providing feedback to your candidates.Read more >Why giving feedback (whether it’s good or bad) will help you hireBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 13, 2023; Last updated: May 2, 2023Giving feedback will not only make candidates you want today more likely to join your team, but it’s also crucial to hiring the candidates you might want down the road. Technical interview outcomes are erratic, and according to our data, only about 25% of candidates perform consistently from interview to interview.Read more >Our business depends on having the best interviewers, so we built an interviewer rating system. And you can too.By Aline Lerner | Published: January 18, 2023; Last updated: May 2, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you’re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world’s best companies. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. To keep our engineer customers happy, we have to make sure that our interviewers deliver value to them by conducting realistic mock interviews and giving useful, actionable feedback afterwards. To keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they’re getting without us. Otherwise, it’s just not worth it for them. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In this post, we’ll explain exactly how we compute and use these metrics to get the best work out of our interviewers.Read more >Hamtips, or why I still run the Technical Phone Screen as the Hiring ManagerBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: October 6, 2021; Last updated: May 2, 2023“Hamtips” stands for “Hiring Manager Technical Phone Screen.” This combines two calls: the Technical Phone Screen (TPS), which is a coding exercise that usually happens before the onsite, and the HMS call, which is a call with the Hiring Manager. By combining these two steps you shorten the intro-to-offer by ~1 week and reduce candidate dropoff by 5-10%. It’s also a lot less work for recruiters playing scheduling battleship. Finally, Hiring Managers will, on average, be better at selling working at the company – it’s kind of their job.Read more >How to write (actually) good job descriptionsBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 23, 2021; Last updated: May 2, 2023When you start writing a job description, the first question you should ask yourself is, Am I trying to attract the right people, or am I trying to keep the wrong people out? Then, once you answer it, write for that audience deliberately, because it’s really hard to write for both…Read more >The technical interview practice gap, and how it keeps underrepresented groups out of software engineeringBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 9, 2021; Last updated: May 24, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade, and five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies. We’ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs. Since last year, we’ve also been running a Fellowship program specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds. All that is to say that even though I have strong opinions about “diversity hiring” initiatives, I’ve acquired them the honest way, through laboratory experience.Read more >Technical phone screen superforecastersBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: November 25, 2020; Last updated: July 14, 2023“The new VP wants us to double engineering’s headcount in the next six months. If we have a chance in hell to hit the hiring target, you seriously need to reconsider how fussy you’ve become.” It’s never good to have a recruiter ask engineers to lower their hiring bar, but he had a point. It can take upwards of 100 engineering hours to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire. Visnu and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the onsite pass rate went back up, and interviewing burnout receded. We didn’t lower the hiring bar, though. There was a better way.Read more >No engineer has ever sued a company because of constructive post-interview feedback. So why don’t employers do it?By Aline Lerner | Published: February 6, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023One of the things that sucks most about technical interviews is that they’re a black box—candidates (usually) get told whether they made it to the next round, but they’re rarely told why they got the outcome that they did. Lack of feedback, or feedback that doesn’t come right away, isn’t just frustrating to candidates. It’s bad for business. We did a whole study on this. It turns out that candidates chronically underrate and overrate their technical interview performance, like so: Where this finding starts to get actionable is that there’s a statistically significant relationship between whether people think they did well in an interview and whether they’d want to work with you. In other words, …Read more >3 exercises to craft the kind of employer brand that actually makes engineers want to work for youBy Aline Lerner | Published: May 14, 2019; Last updated: May 2, 2023If I’m honest, I’ve wanted to write something about employer brand for a long time. One of the things that really gets my goat is when companies build employer brand by over-indexing on banalities (“look we have a ping pong table!”, “look we’re a startup so you’ll have a huge impact”, etc.) instead of focusing on the narratives that make them special. Hiring engineers is really hard. It’s hard for tech giants, and it’s hard for small companies… but it’s especially hard for small companies people haven’t quite heard of, and they can use all the help they can get because talking about impact and ping pong tables just doesn’t cut it anymore. At interviewing.io, …Read more >You probably don’t factor in engineering time when calculating cost per hire. Here’s why you really should.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 24, 2019; Last updated: September 18, 2023Whether you’re a recruiter yourself or an engineer who’s involved in hiring, you’ve probably heard of the following two recruiting-related metrics: time to hire and cost per hire. Indeed, these are THE two metrics that any self-respecting recruiting team will track. Time to hire is important because it lets you plan — if a given role has historically taken 3 months to fill, you’re going to act differently when you need to fill it again than if it takes 2 weeks. And, traditionally, cost per hire has been a planning tool as well — if you’re setting recruiting budgets for next year and have a headcount in mind, seeing what recruiting spent last year is …Read more >What do the best interviewers have in common? We looked at thousands of real interviews to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: November 29, 2017; Last updated: July 14, 2023At interviewing.io, we’ve analyzed and written at some depth about what makes for a good interview from the perspective of an interviewee. However, despite the inherent power imbalance, interviewing is a two-way street. I wrote a while ago about how, in this market, recruiting isn’t about vetting as much as it is about selling, and not engaging candidates in the course of talking to them for an hour is a woefully missed opportunity. But, just like solving interview questions is a learned skill that takes time and practice, so, too, is the other side of the table. Being a good interviewer takes time and effort and a fundamental willingness to get out of autopilot and …Read more >People are still bad at gauging their own interview performance. Here’s the data.By Aline Lerner | Published: September 8, 2016; Last updated: May 2, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous technical interviewing platform. We started it because resumes suck and because we believe that anyone, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to prove their mettle. In the past few months, we’ve amassed over 600 technical interviews along with their associated data and metadata. Interview questions tend to fall into the category of what you’d encounter at a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role at a top company, and interviewers typically come from a mix of larger companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as engineering-focused startups like Asana, Mattermark, KeepSafe, and more. Over the course of the next few posts, we’ll be sharing some …Read more >A founder’s guide to making your first recruiting hireBy Aline Lerner | Published: April 26, 2016; Last updated: May 2, 2023Recently, a number of founder friends have asked me about how to approach their first recruiting hire, and I’ve found myself repeating the same stuff over and over again. Below are some of my most salient thoughts on the subject. Note that I’ll be talking a lot about engineering hiring because that’s what I know, but I expect a lot of this applies to other fields as well, especially ones where the demand for labor outstrips supply. Don’t get caught up by flashy employment history; hustle trumps brands At first glance, hiring someone who’s done recruiting for highly successful tech giants seems like a no-brainer. Google and Facebook are good at hiring great engineers, right? …Read more >Engineers can't gauge their own interview performance.

It can take upwards of 100 engineering hours to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire.

Being a good interviewer takes time and effort and a fundamental willingness to get out of autopilot and …\",\"image\":{\"data\":{\"id\":91,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"fb028-screenshot-2017-11-29-11.52.16.png\",\"alternativeText\":\"fb028-screenshot-2017-11-29-11.52.16.png\",\"caption\":\"fb028-screenshot-2017-11-29-11.52.16.png\",\"width\":1054,\"height\":225,\"formats\":{\"large\":{\"ext\":\".png\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/large\\_fb028\\_screenshot\\_2017\\_11\\_29\\_11\\_52\\_16\\_528b62c8c9.png\",\"hash\":\"large\\_fb028\\_screenshot\\_2017\\_11\\_29\\_11\\_52\\_16\\_528b62c8c9\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"name\":\"large\\_fb028-screenshot-2017-11-29-11.52.16.png\",\"path\":null,\"size\":38.5,\"width\":1000,\"height\":213},\"small\":{\"ext\":\".png\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/small\\_fb028\\_screenshot\\_2017\\_11\\_29\\_11\\_52\\_16\\_528b62c8c9.png\",\"hash\":\"small\\_fb028\\_screenshot\\_2017\\_11\\_29\\_11\\_52\\_16\\_528b62c8c9\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"name\":\"small\\_fb028-screenshot-2017-11-29-11.52.16.png\",\"path\":null,\"size\":13.36,\"width\":500,\"height\":107},\"medium\":{\"ext\":\".png\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/medium\\_fb028\\_screenshot\\_2017\\_11\\_29\\_11\\_52\\_16\\_528b62c8c9.png\",\"hash\":\"medium\\_fb028\\_screenshot\\_2017\\_11\\_29\\_11\\_52\\_16\\_528b62c8c9\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"name\":\"medium\\_fb028-screenshot-2017-11-29-11.52.16.png\",\"path\":null,\"size\":24.55,\"width\":750,\"height\":160},\"thumbnail\":{\"ext\":\".png\",\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail\\_fb028\\_screenshot\\_2017\\_11\\_29\\_11\\_52\\_16\\_528b62c8c9.png\",\"hash\":\"thumbnail\\_fb028\\_screenshot\\_2017\\_11\\_29\\_11\\_52\\_16\\_528b62c8c9\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"name\":\"thumbnail\\_fb028-screenshot-2017-11-29-11.52.16.png\",\"path\":null,\"size\":4.72,\"width\":245,\"height\":52}},\"hash\":\"fb028\\_screenshot\\_2017\\_11\\_29\\_11\\_52\\_16\\_528b62c8c9\",\"ext\":\".png\",\"mime\":\"image/png\",\"size\":16.72,\"url\":\"https://strapi-iio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fb028\\_screenshot\\_2017\\_11\\_29\\_11\\_52\\_16\\_528b62c8c9.png\",\"previewUrl\":null,\"provider\":\"aws-s3\",\"provider\\_metadata\":null,\"createdAt\":\"2022-11-03T13:46:37.644Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2022-11-03T13:46:37.644Z\"}}},\"category\":{\"data\":\\[{\"id\":1,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Data deep dives\",\"slug\":\"data-deep-dives\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-09-27T16:59:29.755Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-05-04T00:41:57.214Z\"}},{\"id\":5,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"For employers/How to hire better\",\"slug\":\"for-employers-how-to-hire-better\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-12-12T19:28:37.748Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-05-04T00:42:11.494Z\"}}\\]},\"authors\":{\"data\":\\[{\"id\":1,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Aline Lerner\",\"email\":\"aline@interviewing.io\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-09-27T16:58:49.743Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2022-09-27T16:58:49.743Z\",\"description\":null,\"tag\\_line\":null}}\\]},\"blogPostSEO\":{\"id\":36,\"metaTitle\":null,\"metaDescription\":\"What do the best technical interviewers have in common?

I know it seems like we are talking about interviewing all the time, but we are usually talking about only one half of the equation: How to be a good candidate. What about the other half? What about the interviewer? In the last decade, there has been an explosion of attention for candidates and how to improve their interview performance. This stands in stark contrast to the preparation of the interviewer. If you are lucky, your interviewer might have gotten a two hour class on how to ask only bona fide work related questions and has sat through two shadow interviews. Maybe they have even done a few interviews! Consequently, there is a lot of bad interviewing being done. That needs to change.Read more >Are recruiters better than a coin flip at judging resumes? Here's the data.By Aline Lerner and Peter Bergman | Published: May 1, 2024; Last updated: May 20, 2024In partnership with the team at Learning Collider, we ran a study to see how good recruiters were at judging resumes. We asked technical recruiters to review and make judgments about engineers’ resumes, just as they would in their current roles. They answered two questions per resume: Would you interview this candidate? What is the likelihood this candidate will pass the technical interview? We ended up with nearly 2,200 evaluations of over 1,000 resumes. We then compared those judgments to how those engineers performed in interviews on our platform. Here's what we learned.Read more >Refuting Bloomberg's analysis: ChatGPT isn't racist. But it is bad at recruiting.By Aline Lerner | Published: April 11, 2024; Last updated: April 17, 2024Bloomberg recently published an article saying ChatGPT has racial bias when evaluating resumes. We re-ran their numbers and saw that they didn't do any statistical significance testing. In other words, there's no evidence of racial bias, at least not in this data set. However, ChatGPT has another kind of bias -- it drastically overestimates the value of top companies and top schools and does non-traditional candidates a disservice as a result.Read more >My manager is not promoting me.

I'm really smart. I got a 4.9 GPA at MIT. By this time I had worked with a pretty wide range of different software languages, tools, frameworks, ideologies, etc. I had managed 30+ people and could also plan and build complex systems solo when needed. I felt very qualified for the positions I was applying for. On my first Big Tech Interview, I did terribly.Read more >The unwritten rules (till now) of negotiating with MetaBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 27, 2024; Last updated: February 25, 2025Recently, while helping our users negotiate, we've observed a string of aggressive, candidate-unfriendly hiring practices at Meta. We’ve seen the same practices with enough candidates, and across enough different titles and positions, that it’s become clear that they are not isolated incidents or a rogue recruiter’s doing but rather a consistent implementation of a deliberate strategy that comes from the top. If you’re negotiating with Meta, you need to know how they operate and understand the unwritten rules of the game. If you do not know the rules, you will fail — long before you even start negotiating.Read more >Want to work from home? That’ll be $46,282.By Elliot Plant | Published: February 14, 2024Software engineering jobs come with a lot of perks. But that doesn’t mean our jobs are perfect. Work requires us to commute, reduces the time we can spend with family, increases our stress levels, and forces us to deal with teammates we don't gel with. And sometimes we work for companies with questionable morals and use technologies we don’t enjoy.  For some of us, it’s worth trading cash for a job that fits into our lives better. But how much cash? To figure this out, we surveyed our users about times they took jobs with lower compensation, why they did it, and how much money they left on the table. We have the numbers!Read more >How hard is it to cheat in technical interviews with ChatGPT?

The results were surprising, but as a preview, know this: companies need to change the types of interview questions they are asking—immediately.Read more >When is hiring coming back?

Having done this a lot, we’ve seen our users make the same two mistakes, over and over, BEFORE they start working with us. These mistakes are costly and make it harder for us to do our jobs. Both involve how you talk to recruiters at the start of your job search, way before there’s an offer.

I simply don't believe that AI can do hiring. My argument isn't about bias (though bias is a real problem) or that it's technologically impossible. It's just that the training data simply isn't available. Most people believe that if you can somehow combine what's available on LinkedIn, GitHub, and the social graph (who follows whom on Twitter etc.), you'll be able to find the good engineers who are actively looking and also figure out what they want. This is wrong. None of those 3 sources are actually useful. At the end of the day, you can’t use AI for hiring if you don’t have the data. And if you have the data, then you don’t strictly need AI.Read more >Does posting Open To Work on LinkedIn help or hurt? A tale of two labor markets.By Aline Lerner and Maxim Massenkoff | Published: April 11, 2023; Last updated: May 29, 2023If you’re a software engineer who’s on the market, should you list yourself as OpenToWork? Does doing so carry a negative signal? And with the recent deluge of layoffs at tech companies, has the meaning of OpenToWork changed? TL;DR It used to be bad. Now, it's not. Moreover, it's clear to us that the people who were laid off in the 2nd half of 2022 and 2023 so far are great... and that, by and large, these layoffs were indeed NOT based on performance.Read more >Why you shouldn’t list certifications on LinkedInBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 14, 2023; Last updated: May 16, 2023People often suggest that interviewing.io should create a certification that our users can post on their LinkedIn profile, e.g., something like “Top 10% performer on interviewing.io”. Presumably, these certifications would signal to recruiters that this person is a good engineer and worth reaching out to and should carry more signal than where said person went to school or worked previously. I've always thought certifications were a terrible idea, and I’ve resisted building them. Now, we've finally dug into the data to see if my hatred of them holds water. TL;DR it does.Read more >We have the best technical interviewers on the market. Here's how we do it.By Aline Lerner | Published: February 28, 2023; Last updated: August 27, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers in a way that no single employer does – if we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In a recent post, we shared how, over time, we came up with two metrics that, together, tell a complete and compelling story about interviewer quality: the candidate experience metric and the calibration metric. In this post, we’ll talk about how to apply our learnings about interviewer quality to your own process. We’ve made a bunch of mistakes so you don’t have to! It boils down to choosing the right people, tracking those 2 metrics diligently, rewarding good behavior, and committing to providing feedback to your candidates.Read more >How software engineering behavioral interviews are evaluated at Meta (from an ex-Meta manager)By Lior Neu-ner | Published: February 14, 2023; Last updated: April 28, 2025Hi, I’m Lior.

Technical interview outcomes are erratic, and according to our data, only about 25% of candidates perform consistently from interview to interview.Read more >How many engineers have gotten laid off in 2022 and 2023 so far?By Aline Lerner | Published: January 27, 2023; Last updated: May 6, 2024I recently ran a Twitter poll asking my followers to estimate how many engineers had been laid off from US-based startups and tech companies in 2022 and 2023 so far. Most people overestimated the number by an order of magnitude. Here's what we did to get to the actual number.Read more >Our business depends on having the best interviewers, so we built an interviewer rating system. And you can too.By Aline Lerner | Published: January 18, 2023; Last updated: May 2, 2023interviewing.io is an anonymous mock interview platform and eng hiring marketplace. Engineers use us for mock interviews, and we use the data from those interviews to surface top performers, in a much fairer and more predictive way than a resume. If you’re a top performer on interviewing.io, we fast-track you at the world’s best companies. We make money in two ways: engineers pay us for mock interviews, and employers pay us for access to the best performers. To keep our engineer customers happy, we have to make sure that our interviewers deliver value to them by conducting realistic mock interviews and giving useful, actionable feedback afterwards. To keep our employer customers happy, we have to make sure that the engineers we send them are way better than the ones they’re getting without us. Otherwise, it’s just not worth it for them. This means that we live and die by the quality of our interviewers, in a way that no single employer does, no matter how much they say they care about people analytics or interviewer metrics or training. If we don’t have really well-calibrated interviewers, who also create great candidate experience, we don’t get paid. In this post, we’ll explain exactly how we compute and use these metrics to get the best work out of our interviewers.Read more >You now need to do 15% better in technical interviews than you did at the start of 2022 (and the bar will keep rising).By Aline Lerner | Published: December 1, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024interviewing.io is a technical mock interview platform and technical recruiting marketplace, so we have a ton of useful data around technical interviewing and hiring. One of the most useful pieces of data in the current climate is the ever-changing technical interview bar – throughout 2022, it’s gotten progressively harder to pass technical interviews, and it’s only going to keep getting harder. We crunched the numbers and came up with a running index that quantifies where the eng bar will be, as a function of open tech jobs. The bar is clearly going up.Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

We dug into the data to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: October 13, 2022; Last updated: December 7, 2024Over the past few months, I’ve seen a number of fear-mongering pieces in the press about how the recession is driving tech layoffs and how tech employees (and engineers specifically) are losing their leverage as a result. The problem is that “tech” can mean anyone working at a tech company. You’re an engineer? Of course, you’re tech. You do ops? Great, you’re tech. You do marketing? You, too, are tech! These are all critical roles at tech companies, and what I take umbrage with isn’t the decision to label non-engineers as tech employees. It’s deliberately misleading your audience by implying that “tech” refers to engineers specifically. I don’t like imprecision, and I really don’t like fear-mongering. So, we at interviewing.io dug into the data to see if engineers do indeed have a reason to fear.Read more >Why we’re pausing our Pay Later ProgramBy Aline Lerner | Published: September 29, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023We recently made the difficult decision to pause our Pay Later Program. In this post, we’ll talk about why we made that call and what we’ll be doing instead to ensure that engineers who can’t afford to pay for practice will still be able to get it.

As such, in the spirit of being useful during a hard and uncertain time, we thought it’d be interesting to survey our users to see what’s actually going on in the market. TL;DR There are lots of engineers actively looking. There are also lots of companies who are actively hiring. Read the actual post to see the full list of 447 U.S. companies who are hiring software engineers right now.Read more >Building interviewing.io's collaborative & replayable whiteboard, or making systems design interviews not suckBy Shehbaj Dhillon | Published: September 6, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023During the spring of 2022, I went from being a user of interviewing.io to being one of the engineers on the team. I discovered interviewing.io in 2021 while preparing for my internship interviews, little did I know that I would end up interviewing for interviewing.io via an interview conducted on interviewing.io to receive an internship opportunity at interviewing.io upon passing the said interview. Yes. During my 11 weeks, I solved an important business problem, quadrupled my problem-solving skills, and collaborated with the fantastic folks who built the product made for engineers, by engineers.Read more >What’s actually going on with Google and Facebook hiring freezes? We surveyed 1000 engineers to find out.By Aline Lerner | Published: August 1, 2022; Last updated: May 6, 2024It looks like we’re entering a recession. One of the hardest things about it is the lack of reliable information about whether companies are still hiring and what hiring freezes even mean. Arguably the two most impactful eng hiring freezes were announced by Facebook (May 4, 2022) and then Google (July 20, 2022). Facebook’s freeze is allegedly partial, targeting roles below L7 and excluding machine learning engineers. Google’s freeze is allegedly all-encompassing but may only last 2 weeks. But what’s actually going on? To make some sense of a bunch of contradictory information about Google’s and Facebook’s hiring freezes in the press and on Blind, we decided to ask the people who, outside of Google …Read more >Does communication matter in technical interviewing? We looked at 100K interviews to find out. By Dima Korolev | Published: May 18, 2022; Last updated: May 2, 2023The interviewing.io platform has hosted and collected feedback from over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. It’s generally accepted that to pass a technical interview, you have to not only come up with a solution to the problem (or at least make good headway), but you also have to do a good job of articulating your thoughts, explaining to your interviewer what you’re doing as you’re doing it, and coherently discussing tradeoffs and concepts like time and space complexity. But how important is communication in technical interviews, really? We looked at the data, and it turns out that talk is cheap. Read on to find out how and why.Read more >We analyzed 100K technical interviews to see where the best performers work. Here are the results.By Aline Lerner | Published: March 31, 2022; Last updated: March 28, 2024At interviewing.io, we’ve hosted over 100K technical interviews, split between mock interviews and real ones. As it happens, we know where our users currently work – they tell us that when they sign up. Given that we have this data AND given that we know how well people do in their interviews, we thought it would be interesting to see which companies’ engineers are especially good at technical interviews. Our resulting top ten lists are in this post!Read more >Announcing our Pay Later Program: Don’t pay for mock interviews until you get a jobBy Aline Lerner | Published: February 9, 2022; Last updated: June 20, 2023In the wake of COVID, I made a public promise to launch a program where engineers could defer paying for practice until they found a job. Today, we’re making good on that promise by launching our Pay Later Program! With this program, you get instant credits to spend on interview practice and then pay us once you’ve found a job. And if you get a job through our job board, then you don’t have to pay anything…Read more >We’ve raised our Series A!By Aline Lerner | Published: October 19, 2021; Last updated: May 2, 2023I’m really excited to announce that we raised a $10M Series A, led by the fine people at M13. This round of funding is a long time coming. I don’t know what the average company age is when successfully raising an A, but it took us 6 years to get here. It was a long and windy path, and for a little while, we almost died (more on that below), but we’re still here, and we’re so grateful and excited to finally have the resources to do what we’ve always wanted to do: fix hiring, for real. What does “fixing hiring” mean? We believe that the only way to really effect change, is to make …Read more >Hamtips, or why I still run the Technical Phone Screen as the Hiring ManagerBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: October 6, 2021; Last updated: May 2, 2023“Hamtips” stands for “Hiring Manager Technical Phone Screen.” This combines two calls: the Technical Phone Screen (TPS), which is a coding exercise that usually happens before the onsite, and the HMS call, which is a call with the Hiring Manager. By combining these two steps you shorten the intro-to-offer by ~1 week and reduce candidate dropoff by 5-10%. It’s also a lot less work for recruiters playing scheduling battleship. Finally, Hiring Managers will, on average, be better at selling working at the company – it’s kind of their job.Read more >Life is chaos and pain.

Five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies. We’ve hosted close to 100K technical interviews on our platform and have helped thousands of engineers find jobs. For the last year or so, we’ve also been running a Fellowship program specifically for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds. That’s all to say that even though I have developed some strong opinions about “diversity hiring” initiatives, my opinions are based not on anecdotes but on cold, hard data. And the data points …Read more >The technical interview practice gap, and how it keeps underrepresented groups out of software engineeringBy Aline Lerner | Published: March 9, 2021; Last updated: May 24, 2024I’ve been hiring engineers in some capacity for the past decade, and five years ago I founded interviewing.io, a technical recruiting marketplace that provides engineers with anonymous mock interviews and then fast-tracks top performers—regardless of who they are or how they look on paper—at top companies.

It’s an interesting question, and one I’m sure many of you job seekers out there are wondering. Internally, we have our own beliefs, but we wanted to see if we could answer this question more objectively. So we set off on a journey to acquire data to try answering it.Read more >Technical phone screen superforecastersBy Alexey Komissarouk | Published: November 25, 2020; Last updated: July 14, 2023“The new VP wants us to double engineering’s headcount in the next six months. If we have a chance in hell to hit the hiring target, you seriously need to reconsider how fussy you’ve become.” It’s never good to have a recruiter ask engineers to lower their hiring bar, but he had a point. It can take upwards of 100 engineering hours to hire a single candidate, and we had over 50 engineers to hire. Even with the majority of the team chipping in, engineers would often spend multiple hours a week in interviews. Folks began to complain about interview burnout. Also, fewer people were actually getting offers; the onsite pass rate had fallen by almost a third, from ~40% to under 30%. This meant we needed even more interviews for every hire. Visnu and I were early engineers bothered most by the state of our hiring process. We dug in. Within a few months, the onsite pass rate went back up, and interviewing burnout receded. We didn’t lower the hiring bar, though. There was a better way.Read more >I’ve conducted over 600 technical interviews on interviewing.io. Here are 5 common problem areas I’ve seen.By Ian Douglas | Published: October 15, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I recently conducted my 600th interview on interviewing.io (IIO). I’d like to share lessons learned, why I approach interviews the way that I do, and shed some light on common problem areas I see happen in technical interviews. Every interviewer on the platform is different, and so your results may vary. We have some excellent folks helping out on the platform, and have a wonderful community working to better ourselves.Read more >6 red flags I saw while doing 60+ technical interviews in 30 daysBy Uduak Obong-Eren | Published: September 15, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023What is the one thing you would look out for if you had to join a company? Sometime between January and February 2020, I wanted to change jobs and was looking to join a new company. This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews – 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. Doing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.Read more >Announcing the interviewing.io Technical Interview Practice FellowshipBy Aline Lerner | Published: July 20, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io because I was frustrated with how inefficient and unfair hiring was and how much emphasis employers placed on resumes. But the problem is bigger than resumes. We’ve come to learn that interview practice matters just as much. The resume gets you in the door, and your interview performance is what gets you the offer. But, even though technical interviews are hard and scary for everyone — many of our users are senior engineers from FAANG who are terrified of getting back out there and code up the kinds of problems they don’t usually see at work while someone breathes down their neck — interview prep isn’t equitably distributed. This inequity never really …Read more >interviewing.io is finally out of beta. Anonymous technical interview practice for all!By Aline Lerner | Published: June 4, 2020; Last updated: May 2, 2023I started interviewing.io 5 years ago. After working as both an engineer and a recruiter, my frustration with how inefficient and unfair hiring had reached a boiling point. What made me especially angry was that despite mounting evidence that resumes are poor predictors of aptitude, employers were obsessed with where people had gone to school and worked previously. In my mind, any great engineer, regardless of how they look on paper, should have the opportunity to get their foot in the door wherever they choose. So, we set out to build a better system. On interviewing.io, software engineers can book anonymous mock interviews with senior engineers from companies like Facebook, Google, and others, and if …Read more >The Eng Hiring Bar: What the hell is it?By Atomic Artichoke | Published: March 31, 2020; Last updated: July 15, 2023Recursive Cactus has been working as a full-stack engineer at a well-known tech company for the past 5 years, but he’s now considering a career move.
